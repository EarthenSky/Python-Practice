The late Sir Clements Markham translated Cieza de León's "Guerra de
Chupas," and wrote the Introduction to the present volume, at the
advanced age of eighty-five years. His manuscript was accepted by the
Council of the Hakluyt Society in November, 1915; but, though the
printing was already in a forward state at the time of Sir Clement's
lamented death, none of the proofs were available for submission to
him. In these circumstances the Council invited us to undertake the
necessary revision--a responsibility which we accepted in the light
of a privilege, and have discharged, to the best of our ability, as a
tribute to the memory of the late venerable President of the Society,
who honoured each of us by many years of personal friendship.

                             INTRODUCTION


Pedro de Cieza de León was, on the whole, the most important
historian, and is now the best authority, on ancient Peru, so far
as his work has reached us; for he was a great traveller, and an
eye-witness of much that he described. For all the events at which
he was not present he received evidence from many actors in them.
He was an intelligent observer, humane and conscientious, striving
after impartiality; and though an enthusiastic admirer of the valour
and endurance of his countrymen, he was horrified at their acts of
cruelty, which he denounces in no measured terms.

Unfortunately only one part of his great work was published near the
time; other parts long lost have been found and published in recent
years, and some yet remain to be discovered. I, the first part,
published in 1553, was the "Cronica," which is mainly geographical.
II, the second part, was the History and Religion of the Incas; III,
the Conquest of Peru; IV, V, VI, and VII, the Civil Wars, viz.--1 War
of Las Salinas, 2 War of Chupas, 3 War of Quito, and 4 War of Huarina
and Sacsahuana. III and VII are still lost to us. Cieza de León also
wrote a book entitled "Libro de Fundaciones," to which he frequently
refers the reader for fuller details respecting habits and customs of
Indian tribes and other particulars. That work is also lost.

The Council of the Hakluyt Society selected the first part of the
"Cronica" of Cieza de León to form a volume of its series in 1864, and
the translation and editing were entrusted to me. It is a valuable
contribution to the geography of the Cauca valley in Colombia, and
of Peru; while the author's account of the coast almost amounts
to a book of sailing directions. In 1880, II, the history of the
Incas, was brought to light, and texts were printed by the late Dr.
González Rosa in 1873, and also by Jiménez de la Espada in 1880. This
exceedingly valuable account of Inca civilization was known to Mr.
Prescott, and he frequently quotes from it; but he was not aware of
Cieza de León being the author.[2] This part was chosen by the Council
to be included in the Hakluyt Society's series in 1883, and I again
undertook the work of translation and editing.

Quite recently three of the volumes on the Civil Wars of Peru by Cieza
de León have been discovered in manuscript, and published at Madrid.
"The War of Quito," covering the period from the arrival of the
Viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela to his death at Anaquito, was translated
and edited by me, forming one of the Hakluyt Society's volumes for
1912. I have also translated and edited the "War of Las Salinas,"
giving a detailed account of the dispute between Pizarro and Almagro,
which ended with the battle of Las Salinas and the execution of
Almagro by Hernando Pizarro.

The present volume, by Cieza de León, is entitled "THE WAR OF
CHUPAS," and contains a detailed narrative of events from the
battle of Las Salinas to the final overthrow of the Almagro faction at
the battle of Chupas, including the murder of Pizarro, the arrival of
Vaca de Castro as governor, the campaign against Almagro the younger,
the promulgation of the New Laws, and the appointment of Blasco Núñez
Vela as viceroy to enforce them.

These Civil War volumes contain a great deal that is of geographical
interest, especially in the detailed accounts of expeditions of
discovery into the forests to the east of the Andes, which to this day
are not fully explored. Cieza de León gives connected narratives of
the expedition of Pedro de Candía into the _montaña_ of Paucartambo,
of that of Pedro Anzures de Camporredondo who entered by Marcapata and
returned by one of the Caravaya ravines, of Diego de Rojas into the
Gran Chaco, of Alvarado and Mercadillo in the valleys of the Marañón
and the Huallaga, and of Gonzalo Pizarro into the "land of cinnamon."
I translated and edited for the Hakluyt Society in 1858 the account
of this last expedition in the Royal Commentaries of Garcilaso Inca
de la Vega. The independent account by Cieza de León contains many
details obtained by him at Quito from members of the expedition very
soon after the event, and is therefore of special interest.

The present volume opens with an account of the extensive journey from
Cuzco to the Collao made by Francisco Pizarro, who had been created a
Marquis for his great services, and treats of his visit to Arequipa
when he founded that city. He had founded Guamanga previous to this
journey. He returned, prematurely old and broken with disease, to
welcome rest in his house at Lima, or Los Reyes, as the city was then
called, devoting himself mainly to business connected with the grants
of estates to his followers and with the improvement of the city he
had founded, interesting himself in the introduction and cultivation
of new plants, the erection of mills, and the supply of provisions.

Cieza de León then, in the next fifteen chapters, makes a digression
which must be acknowledged as such, for these chapters have nothing
to do with the war of Chupas. They contain a narrative of discoveries
and conquests in the region of the Upper Cauca, with Popayán and Cali
as bases of operations, chiefly conducted by a leader named Jorge
Robledo. They are to a certain extent connected with the history of
Peru, because Pizarro nominated the governors who despatched the
expeditions. The real cause of the digression was that Cieza de León
was serving in these expeditions himself. He was an eye-witness of
the events he describes in detail. This gives them a very special
interest, and may well be accepted as a sufficient excuse for the
digression. The story of the famous expedition of Gonzalo Pizarro
follows, and our author then enters upon the events at Lima which led
up to the murder of the Marquis Pizarro.[3]

In the question between Pizarro and Almagro our author strove hard to
be impartial, as well as in his account of the murder of the Marquis;
but his bias on the side of Almagro is apparent. In the case of
Pizarro he tells the authentic story, but he adds any lying gossip
that reaches his ears. In the case of Almagro he never does.

I should be the last to defend Pizarro as the destroyer of the Inca
empire. As such I execrate his memory. He had no right to execute
Atahualpa, although that ruthless usurper and fratricide richly
deserved his fate. Pizarro was guilty of several acts of cruelty, his
worst crime being the order to put Manco's wife to a cruel death when
he was enraged at receiving defiance from the Inca; but I feel that in
affairs connected with his countrymen his memory should receive even
justice, and that he has been misjudged.

Pizarro was no longer the ruthless soldier of the days of Pedrarias.
With great responsibilities and a great position he rose to the
occasion. His proceedings were statesmanlike; his efforts to govern
wisely the country entrusted to him were able and judicious. In
the question which arose when the Spanish king resolved to divide
the vast conquered area between Almagro and himself, he was in the
right throughout. Almagro, with a number of captains anxious for
opportunities to enrich themselves, had set out on an expedition to
Chile. Before starting Almagro took a solemn oath on the Sacrament
that he would maintain his friendship for Pizarro and never injure him
or his interests. Meanwhile there was a great native rising. Pizarro
himself was besieged in Lima, while his three brothers held Cuzco
against a great army led by the Inca Manco. Pizarro received aid from
Mexico and Santo Domingo. The siege of Lima was raised, and Pizarro
sent a force under Alonso de Alvarado to help his brothers at Cuzco,
of whom he had received no news.

It was at this time that the royal order arrived for the division. The
northern part of the conquered empire was to be called New Castille,
and to be governed by Pizarro. The southern half, to be called New
Toledo, was to be Almagro's government. The boundary between them was
to be fixed by a royal arbitrator, not of course by one of the parties
concerned. The rules for the guidance of the arbitrator were clear and
precise. A certain position on the coast north of the equator was to
be fixed by observations for the latitude. A direct line was then to
be taken on a meridian due south for a given number of leagues; at
the end of that line there were to be other latitude observations,
and from the point thus fixed the line west to east was to be the
boundary. Mr. Prescott says that there was ambiguity in the document,
that it was not clear whether the line was to be along the coast or
on a meridian, and he appears to think there were, therefore, excuses
for Almagro's conduct; but there was no ambiguity. The instructions
were quite clear, and it is distinctly stated that the line was to
be on a meridian.[4] Mr. Prescott could not have seen the original
document, which is given in full by Cieza de León. Besides, this begs
the question. The point is that the boundary was to be decided by a
special arbitrator, not by Almagro.

A copy was at once sent to Almagro, who was then returning from
Chile, his captains being much disappointed with the region they
had visited in the northern part of that country. They thought that
the provinces of Cuzco would offer much better chances of enriching
themselves, so they at once declared, and induced Almagro to declare,
that Cuzco was within the boundary of New Toledo. No positions had
been fixed, no line measured, no observations taken; but Almagro and
his needy followers wanted Cuzco--therefore it was in New Toledo. They
even claimed Lima also. The point is not what Almagro thought; for
the decision was not entrusted to him, but to the royal arbitrator.
In point of fact, Cuzco was well within the boundary of Pizarro's
province of New Castille. Long afterwards the Governor Vaca de Castro
caused careful observations to be taken, and Cuzco was found to be
fifteen leagues north of the boundary.[5]

Hernando Pizarro and his brother Gonzalo, having lost their brother
Juan in the siege, were resting after a long, toilsome, and hazardous
defence of Cuzco. Hernando was in a perfectly legal position as the
Marquis Pizarro's deputy at Cuzco until the boundary should be settled
by the arbitrator.

Suddenly the army of Almagro appeared before the city of Cuzco,
claiming it as part of the province of New Toledo. Hernando Pizarro,
terribly outnumbered, prepared to defend it. A truce was agreed upon,
and Hernando for the first time for many days took off his armour and
went to bed. His brother Gonzalo and a handful of attendants were in
the house with him.

Almagro perjured himself, broke into Cuzco in the dead of night, and
attacked the Pizarros in their house.[6] They made a heroic defence,
which is well described by Cieza de León.[7] Finally they were seized
and thrown into prison; while Orgóñez, Almagro's chief captain,
incessantly urged him to behead them. By this time Alvarado was
nearing Cuzco with succour for Hernando Pizarro. Almagro attacked and
routed him, throwing him into prison, and threatening him with death.

It can hardly be contended that Almagro was not guilty of perjury, and
of numerous acts of illegality, tyranny, and treason.

The Marquis Pizarro was very anxious to receive tidings from Cuzco,
for he had heard nothing even of the results of the siege. He had gone
southward along the coast to Nasca. There he received the astounding
news that Almagro had seized Cuzco and imprisoned his brothers. The
report of the defeat and imprisonment of Alvarado quickly followed.
The Governor hurried back to Lima, expecting an attack from his false
and perjured friend. It was not long in coming. Almagro marched down
to the coast and advanced as far as Chincha, on the way to Lima.
He was induced to agree to an arbitration to establish a _modus
vivendi_ until the royal arbitrator should arrive and fix the boundary
line. The Provincial of the Fathers of Mercy (_Mercedarios_) named
Bobadilla, was selected by Almagro himself. There could only be one
fair decision. It was that Almagro should retire from Cuzco until the
boundary was fixed by the royal arbitrator, that the starting point
for measuring the meridional line should have its latitude fixed by
careful observations, and that the illegal imprisonment of Hernando
Pizarro should cease. Almagro refused to abide by this arbitration,
although he had solemnly promised to do so and the choice of an
arbitrator was his own. Soon afterwards Captain Pedro Anzures brought
out a royal order to the same effect, that both Governors should
remain well within their respective provinces, until the boundary was
fixed. Almagro again refused to obey.

The Marquis Pizarro was in great anxiety for the safety of his brother
Hernando. He knew him to be in danger, as Orgóñez was incessantly
urging Almagro to put him to death. At this time the Marquis, in his
well-founded anxiety for his brother's safety, was certainly guilty
of making some concessions, verbally, which he had no intention of
observing.

Almagro was very efficient in his prime, as Pizarro's partner and
assistant, but he was now bowed down by age, as well as by infirmities
the seeds of which he had contracted during a dissolute youth. His
good qualities, which endeared him to his captains, were lavish
generosity and a kindly disposition. He had become very ambitious,
and it is clear that he was quite unprincipled. His own independent
judgment scarcely existed, and he was swayed one way or the other,
as the more violent or the more moderate of his captains had his ear.
For instance, following the advice of Orgóñez, he had actually ordered
the execution of Alvarado when the more moderate counsels of another
captain prevented it.

The weak character of Almagro explains the liberation of Hernando
Pizarro, urged upon him by the moderate party among his captains.
It was certainly unwise if Almagro intended to persevere in his
treasonable practices; and Orgóñez was most strongly opposed to it.
Hernando Pizarro had been kept in close and illegal confinement for
months, and he knew that the most influential of Almagro's captains
was constantly urging that he should be beheaded. It was enough to
try any one's nerves. But Hernando Pizarro's nerves were of iron. The
moment he was released negotiations ceased. The Marquis, owing to
advancing age and infirmities, returned to Lima, while his brother
Hernando took command of the army in the field. He was by far the
ablest soldier then in Peru. Almagro, suffering from a dreadful
disease, retreated with his forces to Cuzco, intending to hold that
city in defiance of all decisions against him. Such was the resolve
come to by his captains.

Hernando Pizarro was certainly in the right when he marched to Cuzco
to resume the position of deputy for his brother in that city, from
which he had been unlawfully and treacherously ejected. He entirely
defeated the Almagro faction in the battle of Las Salinas, and
returned to his post at Cuzco, making Almagro his prisoner, and
keeping the old man's captains under a loose arrest.

Hernando Pizarro was a stern, resolute man, inexorable when once
his mind was made up, but not cruel. He always disapproved of the
ill treatment of the natives, and took measures to prevent it. At
first he had no other intention with regard to old Almagro than to
leave his case to be decided by his brother on his arrival at Cuzco.
But there was a conspiracy among the officers who had served in the
expedition of Pedro de Candía, and the troops under their command, to
kill Hernando Pizarro and liberate Almagro. They were outside Cuzco
and needed help from within. If they had written to one of the more
turbulent Almagrist captains, the plot would probably have succeeded.
But they chose Diego de Alvarado, a strictly conscientious person who
told everything to Hernando Pizarro. That vigilant deputy at once went
to the camp of Pedro de Candía and nipped the plot in the bud.

But he came to the conclusion that there could be no permanent peace
while Almagro lived. When he had made up his mind nothing would move
him. He looked upon it as a political necessity. He resolved to take
the whole responsibility upon himself. The charges were drawn up in
detail, and when the old man begged for his life Hernando urged him,
as it was inevitable, to end his life as became one who had served as
he had done. Hernando Pizarro certainly did not communicate with his
brother on the subject, because, though convinced of the political
necessity himself, he knew that the Marquis would not consent. He took
the whole responsibility, which was quite in character with all we
know of this remarkable man. He returned to Spain soon afterwards with
the royal fifths, but several members of Almagro's party had arrived
before him. Articles were drawn up against him, and he never received
a fair hearing. Charles V could not possibly attend personally to
the affairs of all his vast dominions. Much was necessarily left to
others. In Spain a clever intriguer had gained his confidence. This
was the Secretary, Francisco de los Cobos, who had much power during
the Emperor's absence, and he often used it corruptly and to please
his friends, especially the females of his own family. There was a
flagrant instance in the supersession of the illustrious discoverer
of New Granada, for the sake of such an infamous thief as Alonso
de Lugo, because he had married a sister of the wife of Cobos. The
persecution of Hernando Pizarro was a parallel case. Don Alonso
Enríquez de Guzmán, a violent partisan of Almagro, had hurried back to
Spain, so as to spread his version, and do all the mischief he could
before the arrival of Hernando Pizarro. He was an old friend of the
Secretary Cobos, and when Hernando Pizarro arrived it was a foregone
conclusion against him. Charges had been drawn up, the chief one being
that he had given the young Inca Manco leave of absence, ignorant of
the native plot for an insurrection. At the worst this was an error
in judgment which might well have been condoned after Hernando's
brilliant defence of Cuzco. The main points were slurred over, for
the answers to them would have been conclusive. Hernando Pizarro was
unjustly condemned to imprisonment, first at Madrid, then in the
castle of Medina del Campo.[8]

As soon as the Marquis received tidings of the victory of Las Salinas,
he resolved to leave Lima and make the journey to Cuzco, accompanied
by the Bishop of Quito and other friends. At Jauja he met young Diego
de Almagro, who had been sent to Lima in charge of Gómez de Alvarado,
one of his father's captains. Pizarro received him very kindly,
promised him that his father's life should be spared, and ordered
that the lad himself should be hospitably lodged in the Marquis's own
house at Lima. Continuing the journey, it was not until they reached
Abancay, three marches from Cuzco, that Pizarro received news of the
death of Almagro. He sat apart for a long time, looking on the ground,
and thinking of bygone days with his old friend.

Mr. Prescott and others maintain that the Marquis knew and approved of
the execution of Almagro, and must share the responsibility with his
brother. For this view the only shadow of evidence is that there would
have been time to obtain his approval. But there is clear and distinct
evidence that Pizarro did not know. It consists in the statement of
his travelling companion, the Bishop of Quito.

Throughout this Almagro business, the conduct of the Marquis Pizarro
was correct. Almagro, or rather his captains, were the aggressors,
acting illegally, and treasonably, with a view to their own enrichment.

We next come to the detailed account which Cieza de León gives of the
assassination of the Marquis. Naturally the captains and soldiers of
Almagro's army could hardly expect to receive rewards. Yet Pizarro
very kindly offered _repartimientos_ to at least three of Almagro's
old captains[9] and a good appointment to another.[10] They were ready
for any plot that would secure a change, and they looked to young
Diego de Almagro as the possible leader of a rising in their favour.
They, therefore, came crowding to Lima, where Diego was. The plea of
vengeance for Almagro's death did not influence more than a very few.
Perhaps old servants like Herrada and Balsa, may have mingled some
vindictive feeling with less worthy motives. Those who might really
have had such thoughts, however, were Almagro's intimate friends--his
old captains; yet not one of them[11] would have anything to do with
the plot of the assassins. Vaca de Castro was on his way to examine
and report on the whole subject, and they would await his decision. It
was a plot evolved by the scum of Almagro's faction, headed by Juan de
Herrada, an old servant who saw his way to a higher position as the
chief adviser and protector of young Diego who was himself too young
to take an active part. The poverty of Almagro and his followers has
been grossly exaggerated. The extensive purchases by them of arms and
armour and horses, proves that there was no want of money.

In this volume Cieza de León gives the best and most authentic account
of the murder of the Marquis. Pizarro's heedlessness, in spite of
numerous warnings, is indeed surprising. He went for walks outside
Lima quite alone, especially when he wished to inspect the progress of
a mill he was building. On these occasions he might easily have been
assassinated, and perhaps his immunity led him to disbelieve in the
danger.

It was in June 1847, when I was at a ball in the President's Palace
at Lima, that I first began to enquire into the exact locality of
Pizarro's house. I was dancing with a lady named Elespuru who said
it was not there, but on the opposite side of the _plaza_. Two aides
de camp told the same story, that it was on the site of the present
Callejón de Petateros. I still adhered to my own conviction--that the
palace of the Viceroys, now that of the Presidents, is on the site of
the residence of the Marquis. The question is at last set at rest by
the publication of the _Libro primero de cabildos de Lima_, and of the
geographical official reports. My conviction proved to be right, and I
was dancing with the Señorita on or near the very spot where Pizarro
fell. I have made a plan of part of Lima in those days, showing the
residence of the Marquis, and those of citizens who had received
_solares_ or building lots near his house; and another of the house
itself, according to the descriptions recorded by Cieza de León and
others.

It is clear that Juan de Herrada and his gang of assassins were the
scum of the old Almagro's army. All but one of his former captains
held aloof, disapproving of the murder, and declining to serve under
such a ruffian as Juan de Herrada. The younger Diego de Almagro was
thus under every possible disadvantage. The captain Sotelo alone stood
by him, and Sotelo was murdered by one of the same gang of assassins
before he could be of any great use to the ill-fated youth. Several
of his father's old captains, to whom Pizarro's murder was hateful,
were serving against the son at the battle of Chupas. This lad was the
first _mestizo_ who rose to a very prominent position, and I have,
therefore, written a note on his career, at the end of the chapter
(LXXXIV) containing an account of his execution. I believe
that he was innocent of the murder. He thought that the object was to
seize the Marquis, not to kill him. He said so in his letter to the
_Audiencia_ of Panamá.

Cieza de León gives a very interesting account of the voyage of Vaca
de Castro to Buenaventura, and his journey thence into Peru, where
he was joined by all the loyal captains. He also relates in detail,
the murder of the captain Sotelo at Cuzco, the death of his murderer,
and the proceedings of young Almagro until his final overthrow at the
battle of Chupas and subsequent execution at Cuzco. The account of
the battle of Chupas by Cieza de León is very interesting. It is as
good as, but not better than, that of Zarate, who also came to Peru
soon after the event. Neither of these authors knew the ground. Mr.
Prescott writes of "the bloody plains of Chupas." There are no plains
near the position; it is a very mountainous broken region. I spent a
whole day carefully examining the site, on October 27th, 1852, and I
have therefore added a special note on the position, to accompany our
author's account of the battle (chapter LXXVII).

Mr. Prescott condemns the number of executions after the battle in
the civil wars of Peru, referring especially to Chupas. But in the
case of Chupas, out of twenty-six executions, fourteen were those of
assassins, the rest were aides and abettors of the criminals, also
guilty of treason. The assassination of a royal governor was no common
crime. After the battle of Las Salinas there were no executions. That
of Almagro was months afterwards, and for a different reason. The
executions and barbarities of that cunning and cruel priest, Pedro de
la Gasca, were, it is true, unjustifiable after Sacsahuana; but Mr.
Prescott did not condemn them.

The final chapters of the present work are occupied by two very
different subjects--the expedition led by Felipe Gutiérrez and Diego
de Rojas, told in much detail, and the promulgation of the New Laws,
with some account of their reception and of the appointment of Blasco
Núñez Vela as Viceroy of Peru to enforce them. Cieza de León gives the
complete text of the New Laws.

The Emperor Charles V was a statesman of ability and good intentions;
but it was impossible, as has been already observed, for one man to
give sufficient attention to all his vast dominions. Those numerous
kingdoms, dukedoms, counties, and lordships are enumerated in the
preamble to the New Laws. When at last he found time to attend to the
affairs of the Indies it was twenty years too late. He was convinced
by Las Casas and others that the Spaniards, in their haste to enrich
themselves, were treating the Indians with such cruelty that it must
needs lead to a serious diminution of the population in the near
future. As a statesman, he saw clearly that the value of the Indies
must depend on the preservation and good treatment of the native
races. His view of the course it was best to adopt was statesmanlike.
Probably without knowing it, Charles wished to adopt the policy which
the experience of ages had shown to be the best in all the countries
of the East. The cultivator should be a vassal of the Crown; and what
Charles V called the "tribute" of the Indians was simply the land tax
of eastern countries, the _ryotwari_ system of Sir Thomas Munro in
Madras. It was also the system of the Inca government, and was well
understood by the people. As a rule, the State took two-thirds of the
produce or its equivalent, and the cultivator retained one-third. In
some cases the cultivator received seeds and implements. This land
tax, or tribute, as the Spanish Government called it, should have been
the main source of revenue. So far the Emperor's plan was excellent,
but it came too late. It should have been announced and enforced from
the very first, and rewards to the conquerors should have come from
the State. In 1542 a very different and most tyrannical and ruinous
system was in force. The land tax, with liberty to treat the natives
as they pleased, had been to a very large extent alienated and granted
to adventurers, usually for two or three lives. The Emperor hoped to
obviate this almost insuperable difficulty by ordering all official
bodies, whether civil or religious, to surrender their grants at once;
and all others to cease on the death of the grantee, whether granted
for two or three lives or not, some maintenance being allowed to
widows and children. All grants that were considered too large were
to be reduced to what a judge should decide to be a moderate size.
For Mexico the names of those whose huge grants ought to be cut
down are given. In these ways Charles V seems to have intended that
all the natives of the Indies should become vassals of the Crown, be
well treated, and pay the land tax direct to the State. He trusted,
for obedience, to the loyalty of his subjects in the Indies. He was
disappointed; loyalty had no chance against self-interest. Don Antonio
de Mendoza, the Viceroy of Mexico, did not enforce the New Laws.
He explained that it would cause an insurrection. This excellent
statesman was one of the very few really good men whom the home
government selected. As a rule their choice fell on the most unfit
man they could find in Spain. It would be difficult to choose a worse
governor than Pedrarias. But the home government persisted; and Blasco
Núñez Vela was even more unfit. This first viceroy of Peru was sent
out to enforce the New Laws, and did his best to enforce them. But he
was an incapable martinet without judgment, without tact, passionate,
suspicious, listening to no representation; and he was at last guilty
of a foul murder which gave rise to a formidable insurrection in which
he lost his life.

Cieza de León gives an account of the appointment of Blasco Núñez
Vela, and describes him in most flattering terms. He also relates
how the New Laws were received in the Indies, and fully admits the
cruelties perpetrated by the Spaniards on the natives. Indeed, he
does not hesitate to notice and denounce those cruelties. But it
must not be supposed that all the Spaniards who received grants of
Indians and their land tax were equally cruel. There were many noble
and chivalrous knights among them, who deplored the existing state
of things and treated their own dependents well. Lorenzo de Aldana,
Garcilaso de la Vega, Mancio Serra de Sequidano did not stand alone
in that respect; and, as a persistent advocate of the Indians, and a
denouncer of the cruelties perpetrated on them, we must include our
worthy author, Pedro de Cieza de León.

                                                            C. R. M.


                                NOTE.

There are certain terms which constantly recur in the text and require
explanation, namely, _encomienda_ and _encomendero_, _repartimiento_,
and _Juez de Residencia_.

An _encomienda_ was the grant of a district, with fixed boundaries, to
a Spaniard, with power to appropriate the land tax (called _tribute_)
of the Indians, or to exact personal services from them, or both.
Pizarro made such grants when he formed the first settlement at San
Miguel de Piura, soon after landing, in 1532.

An _encomendero_ was the recipient of an _encomienda_. _Encomenderos_
were expected to reside in the district granted to them.

_Repartimiento_ was the apportionment of a conquered region or people
among the conquerors as _encomenderos_. The word is often used as
equivalent to _encomienda_.

A _Juez de Residencia_ was a Judge or Commissioner sent by the Home
Government to examine into the administration or conduct of a colonial
Viceroy, Governor, Adelantado, or any other official, and submit a
report.

_Alcalde_, Justice of the peace.

_Regidor_, Municipal councillor.

_Alguacil_, a Constable.

_Cabildo_, a Municipality, Municipal body, or even a Municipal
building.

The name by which Cieza quotes the capital of Peru, except in one or
two instances, is "_Los Reyes_" ("the Kings"), it having been founded
at Epiphany. I have substituted the present name "Lima," as more
convenient to the reader. The phrase _Los de Chile_ (They of Chile)
is constantly used in Cieza's text in reference to the members of
the Almagro faction; it was the current expression for Don Diego's
adherents at the time, because the leaders of his party were men who
had served under the elder Almagro in the expedition to Chile which
led up to his disaster.

There were two captains, men of very different type, with exactly the
same name--Francisco de Chaves. This is confusing. One was a friend
of Pizarro, but also a friend of the natives--a man of sound judgment
and high honour. He was struck down by the assassins outside the door
of Pizarro's _sala_, when remonstrating with them. The other, said
to have been a cousin, was the worst of Almagro's captains, and a
thoroughly bad character: to distinguish them I have called the first
Francisco de Chaves (the good), and the second, Francisco de Chaves
(the bad).

FOOTNOTES:

[2] The manuscript in Mr. Prescott's hands appears to have had on
the cover the name of Dr. Sarmiento, President of the Council of the
Indies, to whom it was addressed. Mr. Prescott supposed that he was
the author, and always quotes the manuscript as by Sarmiento.

[3] Pizarro had _encomiendas_ in places called Atabillos and Huaylas,
and it has been said that he was Marquis of Atabillos, but this is
a mistake. An elaborate coat of arms was granted to him, but no
territorial title was ever attached to his Marquisate during his
lifetime. He was simply the Marquis Pizarro. His great grandson was
created Marquis _de la Conquista_. See also my note on page xxxviii.

[4] In my note to the "Life and Arts of Don Alonso Curíguez de Guzmán"
I was misled, by Mr. Prescott's statement that it was not specified
how the line was to be measured, into an error. It was clearly
specified that the line was to be measured on a meridian and not along
the coast.

[5] This was done owing to the representations of royal officials who
had been appointed to the province of New Toledo. After the time of
Vaca de Castro, there was no more heard of New Toledo. The Viceroys
were appointed to govern the whole of Peru.

[6] A lame excuse was invented afterwards that Hernando Pizarro,
during the truce, had broken down the bridges over the Huatanay, the
river that flows through Cuzco. This was false. He had broken down one
bridge, for military reasons, _before_ the truce.

[8] Hernando Pizarro was in prison in the castle of Medina del Campo
for twenty-three years, a terrible fate for so active minded a man.
His detention, however, was not close or severe. When the daughter
of the Marquis Pizarro, by an Inca Princess, arrived in Spain under
the care of her step-father Francisco de Ampuero, she was married
to her uncle Hernando in prison. At length the old warrior was
released, having outlived all his enemies. He went to Truxillo, where
he had property, and lived there to a great age. Hernando Pizarro
had children, and the marquisate was revived for his grandson, with
the additional title "_de la Conquista_." The new Marquis was a
great-grandson of the Marquis Pizarro and also of the Inca Huayna
Capac.

   _How the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro went to the province of
   Arequipa, to found a city there, and divided the natives among
   the persons who would remain there as citizens._


The Governor, Don Francisco Pizarro, determined to go and found
the city of _Arequipa_. The affairs of the town of _Plata_ were in
good order, the captain Pero Anzures having made arrangements for
the maintenance of the settlers, and for the orderly service of the
Indians. Having visited the province of Collao the Governor set out
with the Spaniards who were in attendance on him. He travelled so well
that he arrived at the district where the city was to be founded.
Then messengers arrived with news that the Inca Manco wished to make
peace. This was not true. The captain Gonzalo Pizarro having departed
from Cuzco in search of the Inca, some events happened between
them. Gonzalo occupied a rocky eminence, destroyed two bridges, and
pursued the Inca so closely that he was on the point of falling into
his hands. The Inca was so pressed that he sent messengers to the
Governor. Don Francisco Pizarro was anxious to bring the Inca into
obedience to his Majesty, so he determined to return to Cuzco to
secure that end. While he was on the journey from _Chuqui-apu_[12] to
Arequipa, he reflected that the affairs of Quito were very important,
that three or four cities were already founded there, while there
were reports of provinces where as many more might be founded. So he
resolved to send Gonzalo Pizarro there in accordance with a commission
from his Majesty authorizing him to send one of his brothers as
Governor of those parts if he should think it desirable. Having
come to this decision the Marquis wrote to his brother with orders
presently to set out for Quito. Gonzalo Pizarro, on receiving the
command of the Marquis, set out for Quito with some followers, by the
royal road. He intended to penetrate into the land of cinnamon, where
great riches were reported.

As the Marquis had resolved to return to Cuzco, he directed the
batchelor Garci Díaz Arias, who is now Bishop of Quito, to look out
for the best site on which to found a city. He then, with a small
company, set out for the valley of _Yucay_, when he sent messengers to
the King Manco Inca Yupanqui, proposing that he should come and treat
with him, as he was waiting for him in that valley.

Manco Inca received the news, and showed a desire for peace on his
part. He, likewise, sent messengers to the Marquis that he should make
peace and depart. The Marquis, believing in what the barbarian had no
intention of doing, tried to increase his good will by sending him
a very handsome pillow[13] and clothes of silk. When the Inca heard
of this, he came out on the road, and in place of rewarding the two
messengers, he killed them both and returned to Viticos. They were two
Christian servants of the Marquis. The Inca placed no value on the
friendship of the Spaniards nor on their promise. When the Marquis
was informed of this, he was enraged to find that the barbarian would
yield no obedience to the King, and that he was in such a position
that submission could not be enforced. For this an expedition against
the Inca was not then undertaken.

In this valley of _Yucay_ the Marquis put the principal wife of the
Inca to death. This was looked upon as a great cruelty. The Marquis
had taken her prisoner, and some even say that he, or else Gonzalo
Pizarro, had had more than friendship with her. They even say the same
of Antonio Picado, the secretary. As the Inca would not make peace,
the greatest insult that could be put upon him would be to kill the
wife he loved most. So she was put to a cruel death. She was terrified
and asked why they were going to kill her, when she had done nothing
deserving of death. Finding herself in this extremity she distributed
all her jewels among the principal women who were with her, without
keeping any at all. Then she begged of them that, when she should be
dead, they would put her remains in a basket and let it float down the
Yucay river, that the current might take it to her husband the Inca.
When he learnt this, great was his sorrow. This done, the Marquis
returned to Cuzco.

Soon afterwards the news came that the batchelor Garci Díaz Arias and
those who had remained with him had gone down towards the sea coast,
seeking for a site on which to found the new city; but every place
was difficult and with many defects. All came to the conclusion that
Arequipa was the best place, and so they wrote to the Marquis. He
approved; and he made a distribution, indicating those who were to
become citizens, also naming the magistrates and municipal officers.
He gave the appointment of Lieutenant Governor to Garci Manuel de
Caravajal, a native of Truxillo. After the Marquis had made this
distribution, provisionally until the general distribution could
be made at Lima in concert with the Bishop, he sent orders to Pedro
Anzures at Plata, to take great care about the conversion of the
Indians, and to explore the mines which were reported to exist
near that town. He then set out for the city of _San Juan de la
Vitoria_,[14] where the inhabitants welcomed his arrival with much
content, and he stayed with them for some days. After he had made
arrangements conducive to good government there, he proceeded to Lima,
where the citizens came out to receive him, and he was very honourably
welcomed by all.

At this time fresh despatches arrived for the Marquis from his Majesty
and from several Grandees of Spain. Their date was previous to the
arrival of news of the death of the Adelantado. Among them there was
a commission, with the seal, in which his Majesty, being informed
of the holy life of Garcí Díaz Arias, appointed him Bishop-elect of
Quito. All were rejoiced, for he was much beloved, and they made great
festivities in the city in his honour.

                              CHAPTER II

   _How the General Lorenzo de Aldana determined to send an
   expedition to settle in Anzerma, a place discovered by the
   captain Belalcazar, and how he chose Jorge Robledo to be captain
   of this new settlement._


There was such order in the government of the cities that,
although Aldana had been but a short time in charge,[15] it seemed
quite a different state of affairs from what had preceded it.
Being in the city of _Cali_, Pedro de Añasco went as captain and
lieutenant-governor at Timaná. Aldana charged him to treat the Indians
fairly, and not to allow the Spaniards shamelessly to rob, or seize
their lands, and to punish any one so offending with the utmost
rigour. He wrote to Juan de Ampudia at Popayán to the same effect.
After he had attended to these affairs, seeing that there were still
many men left in Cali, including veterans well versed in the service
of conquest, he resolved to form a settlement in the provinces of
_Anzerma_, which lie further west than the city of Cali, and border
on the very rich and forceful river of Santa Marta. They had been
discovered by the captain Sebastian de Belalcázar. And although Aldana
understood that much profit might result from such an expedition to
any captain who should undertake it, he cast avarice aside; for he
cared more about the good government of the territory entrusted to
him, and considered very carefully what captain he should send on
this enterprise. Though, among those who came from Cartagena, were
Melchor Suer de Nava, Alonso de Montemayor, the _Comendador_ Hernán
Rodríguez de Sosa, and other men of ability who might have performed
the service, Aldana did not see fit to give it to any of these who had
recently come from another government, and had not fought under any
banner in Peru. Among those present in the city of Cali there were few
who complied with that condition. He finally selected Jorge Robledo.
Certainly he did not err, for Robledo was such a man as would serve
the King well, and might well be employed on such a service.

I have seen the power which Aldana received from the Marquis for
making this appointment, and though some asserted that it was
frivolous and without proper authority, they deceive themselves. It
was approved in Spain; and in Panamá Dr. Villalobos, a Judge who was
there at the time, told me that Aldana had a full right to appoint
Robledo. The document of the Marquis states: "That as he had been
informed that there were some provinces discovered but yet to be
settled, if Aldana were occupied in the government and reformation
of the cities, he might nominate such a person as should seem good
to him, to go in his place to make a settlement, and that he himself
gave requisite powers to the person so appointed." As Aldana held
this commission he determined to send Jorge Robledo. First he made
a _repartimiento_ of the Indians subject to the city of Cali, among
fewer citizens than were then at Cali. The rest, and those of us among
the men who had come from Cartagena with Vadillo who most desired to
go, enlisted with Robledo: all being well contented. Lorenzo de Aldana
ordered that the new city that was to be founded, should be called the
city of "St. Anne of the Knights."[16] He appointed Melchor Suer de
Nava and Martin de Amoroto as _Alcaldes_, and Ruy Vanegas as _Alguacil
Mayor_. Having made these appointments, and given the captain Robledo
his orders, he instructed them to leave Cali, taking as few native
servants as possible, and he dismissed many of those they had engaged.
He himself went with them as far as a village called _Meacanoa_,
seven leagues from Cali, and then returned. The captain Jorge Robledo
continued his journey, having started on the 8th of July 1549.[17] In
this expedition I served. After he had arranged these matters, Aldana
departed for the city of Popayán, leaving Miguel Muñoz as Governor's
lieutenant at Cali, and having given the citizens lists of the Indians
they held in _repartimiento_. When he arrived at Popayán he did the
same as at Cali, where, having left Juan de Ampudia as Governor's
lieutenant, he set out for Quito.

At this time Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda obtained a commission from the
Marquis Pizarro to found a town in _Pasto_, but it was not to derogate
from the powers of Aldana; only that if the latter were absent Pineda
might act. When at Quito Pineda heard that Aldana was coming, he set
out with some Spaniards to found the town; but Aldana had already
arrived at the valley of _Guapuanquer_ where he then founded _Villa
Viciosa de Pasto_, afterwards moved to the valley of _Atris_, where it
now is. At the time of the founding an act was ordered to be recorded,
which said that "Lorenzo de Aldana desired to consider Gonzalo Díaz de
Pineda as his colleague in that foundation." Although this is so, in
my first book I did not mention any founder but Lorenzo de Aldana, for
it is clear that he alone had the necessary power for the affair of
those cities. As for saying so of Gonzalo Díaz enough has been written.

When Aldana had founded Villa Viciosa de Pasto he left as Governor's
lieutenant one Rodrigo de Ocampo, a man who well understood a war with
Indians, and he divided the Chiefs and villages among the settlers
who were to remain there. We have written all that relates to the
foundation and site of that town and customs of the natives, in the
_Book of Foundations_. After he had seen to the good order of this
town, Aldana proceeded to the city of Quito, where he remained until
Gonzalo Pizarro arrived; and at present we have nothing more to say
about Aldana.

                             CHAPTER III

   _How his Majesty nominated Don Pascual de Andagoya to be
   Governor and Adelantado of the river of San Juan; and how
   Robledo proceeded to establish the town of Anzerma._


The Licentiate Caspar de Espinosa, he whom we mentioned, some way
back,[18] as having died in the city of Cuzco, was a citizen of Panamá
in Tierra Firme. He received great accounts of the valley of _Baeza_
and the river of _San Juan_, so he sent to his Majesty to petition
for the government of that territory; but just when a grant of the
government was sent to him he died. It was then granted to Don Pascual
de Andagoya, with the condition that he was not to trench on any part
that had been discovered or settled by the Marquis Pizarro, or any
of his captains. After Andagoya's business was settled at Court he
went to Seville and embarked, landing afterwards at Nombre de Dios,
and going thence to Panamá. Although he there got news that the
captain Belalcazar, with the title of the Marquis's Captain-general,
had marked off and settled three or four cities, not on that account
did he cease to covet, and soon he began to collect men and fit out
ships for the voyage. Some people urged him to devote himself to the
exploration and settlement of the territory that was granted to him
and leave the rest, for to do otherwise would be an error. His Majesty
would not deprive the Marquis of what was within his government.
Taking little heed of this advice Andagoya pushed forward his
preparations for departing from the city of Panamá.[19]

Returning to the proceedings of Robledo. After leaving Meacanoa
he made all possible haste to arrive at the region which was his
destination. He made Ruy Vanegas his ensign, and, as in the valley
below there flowed the great river of Santa Marta, the baggage was got
across on a raft, and in a very large canoe. They marched on until
they came to a village which was named _Pescado_, situated on the
banks of that river. Nothing had happened worthy of record, except
that a Portuguese named Roque Martín killed a negress he cohabited
with, by stabbing her. He fled from justice to Timaná, but was killed
by the Indians and eaten. It was a judgment of God, which was clearly
seen in this punishment, for this Roque Martín, without fear of God,
had fed his dogs upon Indians' limbs, which dogs were used by him to
hunt down native men and women. At last, albeit his delight was to
kill so many Indians, yet his end was to die at their hands, and to
find a tomb in their bellies.

From this village Robledo continued his march. His followers numbered
a hundred Spaniards, horse and foot. He went on until he came to
the borders of the province. The natives, having had notice of the
approach of the invaders, had hidden their supplies, and had concealed
themselves in ravines, and in the most secret places of their land.
The captain, after having sent up the baggage from the river to the
heights where they were, and having got all the Spaniards together,
ordered the swiftest among them to make ready, and then sent them out
to search for the natives. Although the latter were well concealed
the runners took more than 200 persons. The captain spoke very kindly
to them, through the interpreters he had brought with him. These were
three Indian women named Barbola, Antona, and Catalina. As the captain
knew that I was curious to learn the secrets of the Indians he gave
Catalina to me, that I might more easily acquire the knowledge I
sought. He told the Indians that they should render obedience to the
King and be friends with the Christians, and that it was desirable
there should be conferences on the subject. In order that they might
understand that faith would be kept with them, he ordered them all to
be set free, telling them to ask their Chiefs to come and confer with
him.

When the people throughout the province understood that the Spaniards
had set their prisoners free, and that they had come to form a new
settlement, several Chiefs and principal men came and were well
received by the captain, who began to treat with them, hoping that
it would please God to bring all the natives of the province to
an attitude of peace. From these Indians it was ascertained that
Spaniards like themselves were coming from the Ocean Sea, that they
had many horses, and were capturing and killing the Indians. Robledo,
on hearing this, consulted with his principal officers, and it was
decided to seek out a site and found a city; for, peradventure, it
might not be people of Cartagena who were coming, and it would be well
to anticipate them, and be first to form a settlement. So the captain
Ruy Vanegas, with twenty Spaniards, horse and foot, set out to find a
site, followed by Robledo and the rest. Before we go on any farther,
it will be well to relate what people those were who were coming.

assume the government. The boundaries of his own province of San Juan
were not fixed.




                              CHAPTER IV

   _How the Licentiate Santa Cruz sent captains and troops in
   pursuit of Vadillo, of the differences there were between them,
   and how they joined Robledo._


I should be well pleased if I could continue my writing without
digressions, for it is quite long enough without treating of other
histories, yet I am obliged to do so that my narrative may be
understood. For I want, above all, to satisfy my readers. Therefore,
with the brevity which is my wont, I will relate the events that we
are following up. The reader is sure to remember that, in an earlier
part of my history I mentioned how, when Don Pedro de Heredia was
Governor of Cartagena, the Licentiate Juan de Vadillo came to hold a
_residencia_. After several things had happened, an account of which I
omit for reasons already given, he set out with followers in the way
I have described in the part where I treated of him.[20] As Heredia
remonstrated, his Majesty appointed as Judge the Licentiate Santa
Cruz, who governed the province of Cartagena well, and founded there
the city of _Mompox_. As Vadillo would not submit, the Judge ordered
troops to be got ready, and sent Juan Greciano as his lieutenant in
charge of them, with powers to administer justice to the men Vadillo
had raised, and orders to send them back to Cartagena. But now, when
the troops were about to start. Judge Santa Cruz made a great mistake.
This was to appoint one Luis Bernal as captain to carry on a war with
the Indians wherever he might pass. Thus with one holding a commission
as lieutenant and the other as captain, the expedition left Cartagena.
Having arrived at the port of Urabá early in the year 1538, they
began the march, and from the first few days parties were formed,
each captain wanting to be superior to the others, while the soldiers
joined those who had most to offer, so that although the men were few,
the confusion was great, and as suspicions increased, the quarrels
became worse. I am not astonished at this for whether in an army, or a
company, or in the smallest province or the widest kingdom, if there
are two heads it is impossible that there can be good government. And
thus, too, said Alexander, when Darius sought for peace by offering
a part of his dominions, that the world could not be governed by two
heads, and that only one could hold the empire.

Marching in the way I have described, the expedition from Cartagena
arrived at the mountains of Abibe, and, as the road had been opened
by us when we came with Vadillo, they crossed the range without much
difficulty. In this forest some young men killed a snake or serpent,
which was so big that it had an entire deer with its horns in its
inside. In what way can the creature have swallowed it! The Spaniards,
and their quarrels, travelled with all possible haste, and after
having gone through great hardships, and suffered much from hunger,
they arrived at the borders of the province of Anzerma. As they
found plenty of provisions they remained there for several days.
The quarrels among them came to such a pitch that Juan Greciano, in
the name of the King, wanted to arrest Luis Bernal, and Luis Bernal,
in the same royal name, wanted to arrest Greciano. Some of their
followers joined one side, and some the other, all taking up arms. At
the time that this happened the captain Ruy Vanegas arrived at a hill
called _Umbra_, on which a town was afterwards founded, and being very
near the other party of Spaniards, they could see each other. This was
why those from Cartagena did not come to blows, which evil would have
been inevitable until one or other of the leaders was killed. When the
two parties of Spaniards saw each other their delight was great.

Ruy Vanegas sent the news to the captain Jorge Robledo who, at
a village called _Garma_, had founded the city of _Santa Ana de
los Caballeros_, now called the town of Anzerma. Thither went the
Spaniards from Cartagena and gave their obedience to Robledo. The
lieutenant Juan Greciano, complained of the conduct of Luis Bernal and
the others, who were banished. Robledo sent messengers to Lorenzo de
Aldana with an account of all that had happened; and Aldana wrote a
very full report to the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro. As the site for
the town presented some difficulties, the new town was removed to the
hill called Umbra where it now stands.

                              CHAPTER V

   _How the captain Jorge Robledo induced the Chiefs in the
   neighbourhood of the new city to remain at peace, and how he
   sent Suer de Nava to Caramanta._


After the usual proceedings at the founding of new cities, steps
were taken to build some houses and sow seeds, and the captain sent
messengers to all parts of the province to invite the Chiefs to come
to him. Among the Chiefs there were two principal ones named _Umbruza_
and _Ocuzca_. Later on, one Gómez Fernández, being lieutenant to
Belalcazar in this province, was so cruel as to burn these two Chiefs
for some very slight cause, and he did the same to other Chiefs and
Indians, without any mercy. Some Chiefs came to see Robledo, who
showed skill in bringing them to adopt a peaceful attitude, and to
serve the Emperor. He was desirous of becoming acquainted with the
people who might be serviceable for the new city. So he sent Captain
Suer de Nava with fifty Spaniards, horse and foot, to the province
of _Caramanta_ to see what villages of Indians there were in that
direction. Suer de Nava departed, while Robledo himself started off
from _Ocuzca's_ village, whither, at the end of a few days, he came
back, bringing with him, in friendly fashion, over two thousand
Indians and many women.

The captain ordered the Spaniards to be prepared, so that they might
not be found unready in case the Indians should think of committing
any treason. At this time the chief Ocuzca came from the wilds and
arrived where the captain was, who received him very well, and let
his coming be known, returning to the city with him, but keeping him
as it were under guard, so that he might not escape. The Chief was
grieved at being kept a prisoner, and one day when some soldiers were
on watch, he saw that they fell asleep. So he departed, and his flight
caused great excitement. We went out in search in every direction,
but could not find any traces to show which way he had gone. At this
time the captain Suer de Nava, who had been at Caramanta, crossed the
range and reached some valleys, where he saw the villages of _Metia_,
_Palala_, and others; and having given the Indians to understand what
they should do, he returned to report to the captain. Robledo then
resolved to visit the province, leaving Martín de Amoroto to guard
the new city. For all the rest of the Chiefs had submitted, though at
first there had been some punishments, such as cutting off the hands
and noses of Indians who were brought in to him from the vicinity.

Being in the village of Garma the captain Ruy Vanegas went in search
of the Chiefs of that place, and came upon a prayer house or sanctuary
that they had constructed as a hiding place. In it were found many
very pretty women, great quantities of coloured cloth and more than
12,000 _pesos_ in gold, which the Christians seized. To pacify the
province the captain ordered most of it to be returned to the Indians.
Ocuzca, the Chief who had escaped, seeing that the captain was absent,
gathered together all the principal Chiefs of his lineage, and with
a large force which they assembled, marched to destroy the new city
of Anzerma. Amoroto, who had been left to guard it, made great
preparations for defence, for an Indian girl belonging to me, a native
of those villages, told me, in great secrecy, about the movements of
the barbarians, and that they were about to attack the city. I at once
reported this to the _Alcalde_, and we were all under arms, night and
day, waiting for the enemy. But the Indians, either not daring or for
some other reason, after having given us some bad nights, dispersed
and returned to their homes.




                              CHAPTER VI

   _How the captain Jorge Robledo sent Gómez Hernández to explore
   the province of The Choco, and also how Ruy Vanegas went to the
   village of Pirsa._


After the captain Jorge Robledo had ordered the spoils that were
taken in the house I mentioned to be restored to the Indians, and
established a peace with the Chiefs of the valley of _Apia_, which
was the largest and most populous of the districts subject to the
city that had been founded, he received news that Ocuzca and
Umbruza, with other Chiefs, had sworn to destroy the new city and
kill all the Spaniards. So he decided to proceed to _Santa Ana de los
Caballeros_, for so the city was named, as we stated when we recorded
its foundation. He arrived there after a few days, and despatched
messengers in all directions urging the native Chiefs not to be
mad, nor to act without considering the consequences, but to render
obedience to his Majesty and be friendly to the Spaniards, and in
such event he would secure to them their lives and possessions, and
would see that they were not ill treated. Some of them thought it
best to comply, and came, bringing materials for building the houses
of the Spaniards. Robledo now wanted to divide the villages among
the Spaniards who had come with him. He had news that, beyond the
cordillera of _Cima_, which lies to the north of Anzerma, there was a
thickly peopled region and much wealth. So, to ascertain the truth, he
resolved to send and explore. He ordered Gómez Hernández to set out
with fifty Spaniards, cross-bow men and shield bearers, and explore
this region of _El Choco_. When they were ready the captain Robledo
went with them as far as the valley of Santa María. Here an Indian
came in friendly guise, alleging that he was the Chief, Umbruza. As he
was known not to be that Chief he was ordered to be burnt, which was
an excessively cruel punishment.

Gómez Hernández left this valley with the Spaniards, but took no
horses with him because of the rugged character of the country, and
proceeded until he reached the forest of _Cima_, which is very wild,
with a dense growth of trees, and where it rains during the greater
part of the year. It contains many noxious animals and night birds.
The monkeys are numerous, and the natives go naked and are very
savage. The Indians have their houses very strongly built in trees,
and they make war upon each other owing to the scarcity of food. The
Spaniards with their cross-bows came to one of those _barbacoas_, or
fortified places, and one of them named Alonso Pérez caught an Indian
girl. She was so overcome with grief and abhorrence at finding herself
a prisoner to a Christian, that she threw herself down a precipice and
was dashed to pieces, her soul going to hell. Gómez Hernández advanced
for some days through these forests, than which there are none more
rugged and impassable in the world, until he came to a river which
flowed into the Ocean Sea and which, according to the most general
opinion, must be the river of Darien.[21] They found some edible
palms, and on them that singular fruit called _pixibays_, which they
liked. There also were many turkeys and pheasants,[22] and many tapirs
which are the size of a mule, and would seem to be like those they
call zebras. Proceeding with his discoveries, Gómez Hernández advanced
until he arrived at the crest of a rise whence they saw that the
country everywhere appeared level and much less mountainous. No open
plain was visible, but undulating country with many and much larger
_barbacoas_ or fortified houses than had been found in Cima. When the
natives perceived the Christians they sounded many drums and flutes,
making a great noise and preparing to come out and give battle.

These Indians also go naked but they are well disposed, their women
beautiful, and they all have gold. It is believed that there are
great riches in these regions, but until now they are unexplored.
Gómez Hernández, and all his followers, being unmounted, were in some
danger of falling into the hands of the Indians who, seeing that they
had come without horses, which are what they so greatly fear, held
the intruders cheap, and rose up in arms to oppose an entrance into
their country. The Spaniards had reached one of those strongholds,
and in it they found plenty of food, and wanted to take some of it.
But the Indians came against them, thinking to lay hold of them.
When the Spaniards saw their approach, they commended themselves to
God, and prepared for battle. Then came a great disaster, which was
that the cords of several cross-bows were broken. The Indians shot
off arrows and darts and the battle was joined. The Spaniards fought
well, though some did better than others, and many were wounded by
the Indians. The affair reached such a point that the Indians, after
having mortally wounded a Frenchman who was there, seized Antonio
Pimentel, a veteran in these Indies, who was near, gave a tremendous
shout, and transfixed his body with a dart. This Pimentel, and another
named Vera, were saved miraculously. For being desperately wounded
they commended themselves to our Lady and, though many Indians passed
by, it was her pleasure that they should not be perceived by them, and
so, strengthened by her aid, they were able to rejoin their comrades.
The Spaniards, being without horses, seeing the number of Indians
increasing, and most of themselves wounded, thought it best to retreat
with their faces to the foe. They were followed for a whole day
when the Indians, satisfied at having driven the enemy out of their
country and wounded most of them, returned. The Indians had captured
the wounded Frenchman, and put him to a most horrible death by cruel
tortures. The Spaniards made speed to return to Anzerma, and report
to the captain what had happened. Robledo then ordered Ruy Vanegas to
proceed to the village of Pirso and try to arrange for terms of peace
with the Chiefs.

Ruy Vanegas set out with those that were necessary, and with horses,
and I went with him. When we arrived at the place we found the natives
in arms. They had deep holes dug in the approaches, and in them were
many spikes. These holes were covered over with grass, so that the
horses and Christians might fall into them. As we entered the village
the Indians fled into the ravines and among the rocks behind the
village. Because a horse fell into one of the holes and was killed on
the stakes, the Spaniards threw into two of them over fifty Indian men
and women, to teach them not to try another deceit like that, as it
would be to their own hurt in the end. After having been some days in
this district, Ruy Vanegas had sent messages to the Chiefs to come as
friends, and we went on to the province of _Sopia_. Here, though the
barbarians were proud, yet, knowing the power of the Spaniards, they
came in peaceably and gave obedience to his Majesty, which they have
observed ever since. After Ruy Vanegas had settled those provinces he
returned to Anzerma, and reported to the captain what he had done.

                             CHAPTER VII

   _How the captain Jorge Robledo assigned the Chiefs among the
   settlers who had to remain in the city of Santa Ana, and how he
   departed and discovered another part of the great river of Santa
   Marta._


The events we have related having passed, the captain Jorge Robledo
desired to cross the great river Santa Marta, and explore the regions
on the other side. He first divided the native Chiefs among those
who had to remain as settlers; and then, having assigned them, he
left the captain Ruy Vanegas in his place, and departed from Anzerma
early in the year 1540, taking with him as his ensign Suer de Nava, a
native of Toro. We set out, a little over a hundred Spaniards, horse
and foot. The _Comendador_ Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa was Camp-master.
We arrived at the village of _Irra_, which is on the banks of the
river of Santa Marta, where the current flows with great velocity.
The natives made rafts on which the horses and baggage crossed. The
Spaniards made contrivances for crossing consisting of two bamboos as
thick as a leg, to the head of which a pole was fastened. One man went
in front with a reed, hauling on the bamboos, and two others behind
to guide them. Thus, with great risk and much hard work the Spaniards
crossed this great river. I certainly believe that if the Romans had
undertaken the conquest of these parts, even at the time of the most
flourishing period of their empire, when they ruled the world, they
would not have been powerful enough to do what a few Spaniards have
achieved. As for the hardships and hunger they have faced, no other
nation in the world could have endured it. For they are worthy to be
counted as scions of the most excellent nation in the world and the
one which is foremost in all things.

Having crossed to the other side of the river we went to sleep on the
rising ground, whence the captain sent messengers to _Carrapa_, which
is a large and rich province with abundant supplies of provisions,
to persuade the inhabitants to receive him as their friend and to
yield obedience to his Majesty. As the fame of the Spaniards' valour,
their great power, and the endurance of their horses had reached
all these districts, the natives agreed, in order to escape being
wounded by swords or torn to pieces by dogs, to admit them to their
territory and supply them with provisions; and this they sent to say.
Next day we entered Carrapa. The Chiefs came to see the captain, and
presented many golden ornaments, and vases, among them a salver which
weighed over 2,000 _pesos_. We were there more than a month. The
Indians said that after crossing the cordillera of the Andes there
was a very populous plain country where there were great and very
rich Chiefs, and that that country was called ARBI. They also said
that near it were the provinces of PICARA, PAUCURA, and POZO, all
great and powerful, and hostile to each other. At that time those of
Carrapa were at enmity with Picara. After we had stayed for the time
mentioned the captain asked for guides to advance further, also that
some principal natives should come with the number of men he might
want, to make war on those who refused to be friendly. The people of
Carrapa were content, and gave 600 Indians to carry the baggage on
their shoulders and 4,000 armed men to help in the war. Thus we left
Carrapa and went to the province of Picara, which is larger and more
populous. When tidings came of our approach, the natives of Picara
armed themselves for war, but after they had made a tremendous noise,
they grounded their arms and fled. Those of Carrapa pursued them, and
killed many in the ravines. Others they made prisoners, and ate them
all without sparing any. Such is the cruelty and savagery of these
people!

Our camp was formed on a plain. The captain Robledo, the first
discoverer of these regions, sent messengers to all the villages of
that province to warn the natives that they must come in and render
obedience to his Majesty, for that otherwise he would wage war with
ruthless cruelty. Most of them, fearing their cruel enemies of
Carrapa, determined to come and offer peace to the Spaniards. During
the few days that we were encamped on that plain, the principal
Chiefs, named _Picara_, _Chanvericua_, _Chuscuruca_, and _Ancora_,
came to our camp. When the _repartimiento_ was made, this last one
was given to me in _encomienda_, with other principal men, I being
a _conquistador_ of these parts. These Chiefs brought many gold
ornaments, rich and of much value, which they gave to the captain, who
took possession for his Majesty, and for the royal crown of Castille.
Having made some agreement convenient for them and for us, the captain
ordered the men of Carrapa not to kill any more people, nor to do
any more harm than they had done already. After having been in this
province twenty-five days, we set out for _Pozo_, which is situated
among some breaks in a mountain range, the Chiefs having their houses
and compounds on the slopes higher up. At the approaches there are
fortifications of stout bamboos, and above these are _barbacoas_ or
platforms for making their sacrifices upon, and for use as watch
towers.

These Indians are the boldest and most valiant in all the Indies of
Peru. None of them are ever in their plantations, sowing or gathering
the produce, without having their arms ready at hand. They were feared
by all their neighbours and they would not keep at peace with any one.
Both men and women go naked. They have much gold. Their territory
extends to the river of Santa Marta. They came originally from among
the people of Arma. Their weapons are lances, darts, and slings; but
of this I treat more fully in my _Book of Foundations_. They had news
of our entrance into Picara, and of what we had done in Carrapa, but
they trusted in the strength of their fortified places, and held the
Spaniards of little account. Having made great sacrifices and prayers
to their gods, and having spoken with the devil in accordance with
their customs, more than 6,000 of them assembled, with their arms, on
the summit of their mountains, to defend the pass. We set out from
Picara, as I have said, with more than 5,000 Indians of that province,
led by their principal Chiefs, all eager to attack the province of
Pozo and kill its inhabitants.




                             CHAPTER VIII

   _How the captain Jorge Robledo arrived in the province of Pozo,
   where he was severely wounded, and of the most cruel punishment
   that was inflicted, also of the great quantity of human flesh
   that was there eaten._


To go from the province of Picara to that of Pozo one follows a
river, down stream. It is fringed on either side by woody groves and
fruit-bearing trees, and 'tis certain that, if the Inca kings should
extend their conquests so far, and the opposing parties should not
eat each other up, they would find here the best and richest thing
in all the Indies, the rivers and mountains being so prolific in
gold, as those who have visited it will tell. We were going along,
careless of the fact that we were at war, advancing without order,
and rejoicing to see that there was such a good land to explore. The
captain was in front, and with him were Alvaro de Mendoza, Antonio
Pimentel, the ensign Suer de Nava, Giraldo Gil Estopiñan, Francisco
de Cuéllar, trumpeter, and a cleric named Father Francisco de Frias,
besides some other mounted esquires, and gentlemen on foot. Suddenly
the war cries of the barbarians were heard. In great haste orders were
given to call up the _Comendador_ Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa who, as
squadron commander or Camp-master, came in the rear guard with the men
on horseback. He hurried up to the front, and so did Pedro de Velasco
and I, and others, all being without a thought that the Indians would
be so eager to fight. The captain, with his ensign Suer de Nava,
climbed up the mountain side with great intrepidity, as did the other
Spaniards: while the barbarians made a tremendous noise, and called
us _umes_, which means women, also making use of other more insulting
expressions.

The Indians of Carrapa and Picara, although they numbered over 8,000,
were so afraid of the Pozos that they hardly dared open their mouths.
At this juncture we came to a very difficult mountain pass. The
captain, with much boldness and with the heart of a hero, put spurs
to his horse and, in spite of the foe, nearly reached the summit: the
Spaniards following and invoking the apostle Santiago. They then began
to wound the Indians, and these shot off many darts and arrows. The
captain gave his shield to the trumpeter, because he saw that the man
had none, and taking a cross-bow, he killed three or four Indians;
then, dropping it, he took a lance and prepared to attack them,
having first, before all this, called upon them, in presence of the
notary Pedro Sarmiento, to submit. When the Indians saw the execution
the captain had done amongst them, one of them pointed a dart which
hit him on the right hand, and passed right through it. While stooping
down to recover his lance the Indians shot off another dart, which hit
him in the back, and entered more than a _palmo_. The Spaniards then
pressed onwards, to put the Indians to flight, and gained the heights.
The captain lay on the ground, much afflicted by his wounds, so that
we all thought he was dead. Indeed, as for his living, it would have
been better for him had he died there and then, for at least his
body would not have lacked a tomb, nor would it have become food for
Indians, as happened later, owing to the savagery of those who did
kill him.[23] None of the Spaniards were either killed or wounded here
except the captain.

The friendly Indians killed some of the enemy, whom they ate that
same night. We occupied the native buildings which were on the hill.
They were large, and there were a great number of wooden images in
them, of the size of men, but in place of heads they had skulls with
faces of wax. They served us for firewood. The captain was so ill that
we really thought he would die, and all showed deep sorrow, for, in
those times, Robledo was so much liked for his goodness to us, that
we looked upon him as a father. At night the ensign, Melchor Suer de
Nava, the Father Francisco de Frias, a native of Castro Nuño, Alonzo
de Mendoza, Antonio Pimentel, Pedro de Velasco, Estopiñan and others
of the officers who were there, slept close to him without leaving the
house where he was. Such hatred was felt for the Indians of Pozo who
had done this deed, that the _Comendador_ Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa,
with seventy Spaniards and about 4,000 friendly Indians, set out in
search of the enemy (who were said to have taken up a strong position
on a rock placed on the summit of some crags) intending to kill as
many of them as possible. The Indians of Carrapa and Picara were
delighted on finding their dreaded enemies in such straits, and that
the valiant Spaniards were so bent on killing them. They all brought
stout cords to secure the prisoners. The _Comendador_ went out with
the Spaniards to do what I have said: and it pleased God that the
captain should recover from his wounds, which gave no small pleasure
to us all.

FOOTNOTE:

[23] He was hanged by Belalcázar on the pretence that he had usurped
that governor's territory, and his body was eaten by the Pozos.
For this murder Belalcázar was condemned to death by the _Juez de
residencia_. Belalcázar appealed, and was on his way to Spain when he
died at Cartagena.




                              CHAPTER IX

   _How the Comendador Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa came to the rock,
   and of the number of people he captured and killed, and of the
   great cruelty perpetrated on those natives._


It is my well-used custom to praise the good deeds of the captains
and people of my nation, but also not to pardon their evil deeds. How
much affection soever I may feel for some of them, it may be believed
that I shall not fail to blame their errors. I saw this conquest and
war and was present at it, and I shared in the love which all felt
for Robledo: the more so because I used to go to his house at that
time. And I speak the purest truth, though many things also happened
which I do not mention, because I am so tired and bored with treating
of the provinces to the westward. Although, as I say, I care so much
for the honour of Robledo, I shall not hesitate to affirm that there
was committed, in this province of Pozo, one of the greatest acts of
cruelty that have been perpetrated in these Indies. This was that,
because the unlucky natives wounded Robledo, the Spaniards felt
such hatred towards them that those who went to inflict punishment
resolved to kill them all.

At the time when they were defeated on the first hill, their principal
Chief, much disturbed at such a calamity, retreated to the banks of
the great river, with his women and principal followers, while others
of his captains went to form a garrison on the summit of a very
inaccessible rock, which rose from the crest of one of the hills. Here
a thousand persons were collected, men and women with many children,
boys and girls, and a supply of provisions. The Christians, who came
with the _Comendador_, sent the news of how they had beleaguered
those people in their fort, and they marched towards it. When they
were near, those of Pozo wished to defend themselves, but they were
astonished and dismayed at so many coming against them. Our friendly
Indians, from below, encircled the rock, and the Christians farther
up sent forward the dogs, which were so fierce that in two bites with
their cruel teeth they laid open their victims to the entrails. It
was no small grief to see that, for taking up arms to defend their
country against those who came to deprive them of it, they were
treated in that manner. The little children, terrified at the noise
and confusion, running hither and thither, were torn to pieces by the
dogs, a horrible sight to witness. The cross-bows also made holes
through their bodies, through which their souls could depart, while
they groaned and cried for help to their parents and their gods; or
in fleeing from the Spaniards they threw themselves over the cliffs.
Those fugitives who escaped from these perils fell into a worse
danger, namely, into the power of the Indians of Carrapa and Picara,
who treated them with even greater cruelty. For they spared none,
neither ugly nor beautiful women, neither old nor young, killing all.
They took the children by their feet, and dashed their heads against
the rocks, and promptly, like dragons, ate them raw. They killed most
of the men they took, and the rest, with hands securely tied, they
carried off. Baltasa de Ledesma and the _Comendador_ acted here in
such a manner that one must believe it was for this crime that they
were killed in course of time at this same place, when they and the
captain were eaten by these very Indians.

After this no people remained on the rock. More than three hundred
of those who had been there were killed. The _Comendador_, with the
other "Christians," returned to the camp. Our native friends made
more than 200 loads of human flesh, and with it and their prisoners
they also returned to their camp, eating the lungs and hearts raw, as
they went, and entrails too. When they arrived at the buildings they
sent to their villages large presents of this flesh, as well as many
of the Indians they had kept alive. Those who remained were forced to
bend their heads and were killed by blows on the occiput with cudgels.
And the only reproach they got from us was to be laughed at and asked
whether that food tasted good to them. I saw that they brought more
than twenty pots as big as our large earthen jars, and filled them all
with this human flesh, which they devoured among them, sending the
heads to their villages. A time came, when God permitting, the Pozos
did more damage than this to their enemies, as we shall relate farther
on.

When the news of the great injury the Christians had done spread to
all parts of the province of Pozo, the people were astounded and
afraid, and, that there might not be such a sad day again, the Chiefs
determined to send to the captain and ask for peace. This was done.
They came to the camp with presents of gold ornaments, and were
well received by the captain, who promised them peace, provided the
principal Chiefs came in, and rendered obedience to his Majesty. After
some negotiation they did so, and after begging pardon for having
taken up arms they asked the captain that no more harm might be
done to them. The captain agreed, the Indians of Carrapa and Picara
returning to their own countries. When the captain's wounds were
healed, he arranged to depart from Pozo, and they brought him many
Indians to carry the baggage of the Spaniards. And so, leaving all in
peace, we departed from Pozo.




                              CHAPTER X

   _How the captain Robledo discovered the province of Paucura, how
   the ensign Suer de Nava returned to Pozo, and how he perpetrated
   other cruelties worse than the former ones, and how Robledo
   left Paucura to explore the great and very rich province of
   ARMA._


What I have related in the last chapter having taken place, and the
captain having recovered from his wounds, we departed for the province
of Paucura, where the principal Chief was one named _Pimaná_, who
was also an enemy of the people of Pozo, but allied by lineage,
speech, and customs to those of Picara, a populous and very fertile
province. As they had heard what the Christians had done in Pozo, and
were friends of Pimaná's relations in Picara, they agreed to submit
peaceably and to bring in plenty of provisions, and so it was done. We
arrived at Paucura in the afternoon of a Wednesday, and they showed
much joy at our coming. So we lodged there as friends. When all our
force had arrived, a soldier named Miranda said that certain pigs,
which had gone amissing from the men who were bringing them, had been
stolen by the Indians of Pozo. It was no great crime, nor ought it
to have been punished with the cruelty which we must now describe.
When Robledo was told of the loss of the pigs he was very angry,
saying that the Pozo Indians had not kept the peace to which they had
agreed, and that he would punish them for being false friends. He
then ordered his ensign to go with fifty Spaniards, horse and foot,
to Pozo and punish the theft of the pigs. When the people of Paucura
heard of the return of the Spaniards to Pozo they rejoiced at the
good opportunity of doing all the injury they could to the people
of Pozo, who were their enemies, so when Suer de Nava left the camp
he was joined by over 3,000 Paucuraños. All united marched rapidly
and, arriving in Pozo, they began to do great harm to the unfortunate
people, burning their houses, ruining their villages, and robbing what
they contained. That the sin might be greater, more than two hundred
souls were murdered by the Paucuraños, who cut the bodies in pieces
as if they had been saddles of mutton or legs of beef, and carried
them off to their homes. It was surely a strange thing to see rational
beings so very fond of human flesh, so that to obtain it there was no
peace between fathers and their sons and brothers. As soon as Suer de
Nava had recovered the pigs, and settled some terms of peace with the
Pozo people, he returned to the province of Paucura where the captain
had remained.

Robledo had received tidings that at no great distance to the
westward [_sic_] was situated the great and very rich province of
ARMA, which is the largest and most populous in all Peru, and
where, if the natives could be domesticated, such a supply of gold
might be obtained that the Spaniards settling there would become the
richest in all those parts. Desirous of exploring these regions in
order to form a new settlement, Robledo made his preparations and left
Paucura accompanied by some of the Chiefs and many Indians; and we
went on until we reached the crests of some mountains.

By this time the arrival of the Spaniards was known in all the
villages of that great province. Our deeds were exaggerated. It was
said that with one blow of a sword we could cut open an Indian,
and with one thrust of a lance we could run him through, but what
terrified them most was to hear the way a bolt was shot from a
cross-bow, and the furious velocity with which it flew; while they
also wondered at the speed of the horses. Finally they had debated
among themselves as to whether they should keep the peace with us or
come out to make war on us, and they had consulted their devils in
regard to this. One may believe that the reply and counsel savoured
of the oracle who gave them, and all watched for the part where the
Spaniards would approach, to decide on what they would do. We set out
from where, as I have said, we passed the previous night, and marched
to the borders of the province. When we came in sight of a summit we
heard a great noise, many drums beating and horns being blown. It
was so in truth, for when the natives saw us coming that way they
concealed their property and their women and children, and of one
accord came out in warlike array to face us. When the captain heard
the noise, he ordered all his men to form in order with their arms,
and march to the summit. This was done. The shouts of the natives
increased, while we advanced in leisurely fashion towards them. And
although they tried to dismay us with their clamour, and by means
of huge stones sent rolling down the hill, it availed them nought,
because the daring of the Spaniards is so great that nothing in the
world can daunt them; and so, in spite of all, they reached the summit
and put the Indians to flight.




                              CHAPTER XI

   _How the captain Robledo explored the province of Arma and fixed
   his camp in the village of the principal Chief, named Maytama;
   and of other notable things that happened._


Having gained the summit, the Spaniards continued to follow the
Indians, killing some of them, and we saw that they were adorned with
very beautiful ornaments of gold. They also had plumes of feathers,
crowns, and large plaques, and some were seen who were in armour of
gold from head to foot. It was certainly beautiful to see some of the
pieces they took, and from this the range was called _La Loma de los
Armados_. We lodged in two of the houses there, very happy at finding
that God our Lord had presented us with so rich and populous a land,
in order that, being by us discovered, His name might be worshipped
and the Holy Gospel preached.

On the following day we departed thence, and saw that the province was
very large, full of villages, planted with maize and great rushes, and
that there were groves of fruit trees, and palms yielding _pixibays_.
The villages on the slopes and higher ground contained circular houses
so large that there was room for fifteen or twenty people in each.
There are many other things to tell of this province, which I have
written in my _Book of Foundations_, where the reader will have seen
them.

When we were passing out of a valley we heard a still greater noise
at the top of the next range of hills, whither the road that we were
taking led; and, marching more quickly, we came to the beginning
of the rise, and saw that the pass was difficult before reaching
the summit, for, besides presenting a steep ascent there were some
rocks and gullies which would make it necessary for the horses to
go gently, without attempting to press quickly forward. The captain
demanded peace from the natives, and obedience to the Emperor; if this
was refused he would make ruthless war. The Indians, deriding these
demands, replied to us that we came to conquer and to rob what did not
belong to us, that we should return to our own country, and leave them
quiet and at peace in theirs. Having said these words and others, they
shot off many darts and stones, showing that they intended to defend
the approach to their village.

The captain seeing that the barbarians intended to defend the pass,
and that the noon-day heat was coming on, ordered the foot soldiers
to lose no time in attacking the Indians with shields, cross-bows and
dogs, in order to take the pass, so that the horses might be able to
come up. In this they were successful, while some of the horsemen,
laboriously seeking a way by one or other side of the mountain in
spite of the Indians, found a place by which they were able to come
up with the horses, to the position reached by the men on foot. Then
the shouting was greater, for the Indians did not dare to await the
coming of men who they saw were so valiant; and not caring to hear
the neighing of the horses, turned their backs and began to run away,
abandoning their arms--the cowards. The mounted men followed and
overtook some of them, taking a quantity of gold in ornaments such as
I have said they have. All the Spaniards who were behind having come
up, we proceeded to encamp on the summit, which they called _de los
Cavallos_. Here they found but little maize, as it was only in leaf.

The Chiefs and principal people of those villages, astounded at seeing
the majesty of the Spaniards and their great power, and fearing to
oppose them more, agreed to go to the captain peaceably. So they came
to our camp with nets full of ornaments of the finest gold, asking the
captain for pardon for having been so mad as not to have laid down
their arms sooner. The captain received them very well and agreed to
the peace. As the inhabitants of those villages were so rich they
made presents of gold to the Spaniards. When they brought water for
the horses, they offered very large and fine golden ornaments, so
fine that they exceeded 21 carats. That night the captain sent the
_Comendador_ Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa, with a sufficient force to the
village of one _Maytama_, who was the principal Chief of the province,
to capture him or oblige him to render obedience to his Majesty. The
_Comendador_ started during the first night watch and marched until
he arrived at Maytama's hill. He found the Indians ready for war,
and, attacking them until daylight, he put them to flight, captured a
brother of Maytama, and saw them, both men and women, take away many
loads of gold. The Spaniards could only capture a few because the
thickness of the maize in the fields was so great. For this reason
the Indians escaped with most of the gold, which if it had been taken
would have been a great booty, nevertheless the Spaniards and their
servants took some.

The captain, with the whole camp, arrived the next day. As it was
known throughout the province that the Spaniards occupied the
buildings of Maytama the natives sent messengers proposing to be
friends and offering great presents of gold. The gold was brought in
this way: the Indians came with much shouting, bearing long poles
from the shoulder of one to that of another, from which there hung by
cords the plaques, crowns, bracelets, and plumes of gold. On arriving
where the captain was, they set them down before him, and thus the
presents I have mentioned came from all parts of the province. The
Chief, who was a prisoner, sent an old woman to bring gold, and next
day she brought about 2,000 _pesos_, at which we were astonished. The
Chief said that he had more gold buried and that he wanted to go and
fetch it. He asked the captain to tell off some Spaniards to go with
him, intending to escape if it were possible. The captain ordered
some soldiers to go with him. When they came to some precipitous
rocks, hating to remain in the power of the Spaniards, he determined
to kill himself. With a barbarous and heathen mind, he hurled himself
down over the precipice and left his brains among the stones, so that
when the Spaniards reached the place, the Chief's soul was already
in hell. The Spaniards returned to the captain and explained to him
the manner of the captive Chief's death. Principal natives came to
the camp each day with presents of gold, and the captain came to the
conclusion that he had arrived at a good place for founding a city.
He determined to send the _Comendador_ Hernán Rodríguez de Sosa to
explore the region lower down the great river, and to remain there. He
set out with forty Spaniards, horse and foot. The _Comendador_ came
to a large village which he called _Pascua_ because he passed Easter
there; continuing his advance he came to another village, where he met
with some resistance. Leaving it, and taking a northerly course, he
discovered the village of _Cenufara_ and a place they called _the Hill
of Maize_. Advancing further he arrived at a village called _Pobres_,
whence he returned to the region of Arma, because he learnt, from
statements he received, that there were no other settlements for a
great distance.

At this time the inhabitants of the province of Arma conceived
such hatred for the Spaniards that they determined to make war in
common against us. This appeared from their not coming to our camp
as usual, nor supplying us with provisions; while they killed our
Indian servants and negroes who fell into their hands. The captain
got notice of this league and conspiracy, and ordered his men to be
on their guard against any sudden attack on the camp by Indians. But
when they were all determined to rise against us, they failed to come
to the point, owing to some disputes among themselves, and we saw them
fall back well supplied with gold ornaments. When the _Comendador_
returned, the captain resolved to quit the province, and departed,
leaving it as hostile towards us as when we entered it. When we were
about to depart, a number of Indians stationed themselves above our
camp. The captain saw this and told the interpreters to call upon them
in a friendly way to come down. They came, believing they were in no
danger. The captain ordered all of those who came to be thrust inside
the huts and issued orders to the Spaniards to give them wounds and
cut off their hands. In this way more than thirty were mutilated, as
many more being killed. In that state the survivors were sent to their
villages. Then the captain quitted the province of Arma. He intended
to leave his ensign Suer de Nava there, to found a city; but, thinking
it would be better to explore the province of Quinbaya, that plan was
given up. Leaving Arma, and following the way by which he had come,
the captain arrived at the province of Paucura, whence he departed for
Pozo. There he seized several principal men and went to Carrapa, where
he burnt one of them for some very trifling reason; and here we must
leave him, because it is necessary to relate the manner in which the
captains Pedro de Añasco and Juan de Ampudia met their deaths.




                             CHAPTER XII

   _How the captain Osorio was killed, with some other Christians,
   going to the new kingdom, and how the captain Pedro de Añasco
   was also killed by the Indians._


Let the reader's attention be now turned to the exploration of the
province of Bogotá by the Spaniards coming from Santa Marta, which we
mentioned in the first book of _The War of Las Salinas_, and to what
happened between them and the captain Belalcazar. I also related how
the captain Añasco founded the town of Timaná, where, after coming
from Cali when Lorenzo de Aldana was General of those cities on behalf
of the Marquis Pizarro, he was confirmed in his charge, and returned
as lieutenant to the said town of Timaná. The captain Juan de Ampudia
was lieutenant in Popayán, Miguel Muñoz in Cali, and Lorenzo
de Aldana had gone to Quito, as we have already stated. While this
region was under these lieutenants, glowing accounts reached them of
the wonderful richness of the new kingdom,[24] the quantity of gold
and emeralds there, and the high value of commodities; so that there
was a desire to take thither all the merchandize and flocks that
could be collected. A merchant who was at Popayán, named Pero López
del Infierno,[25] Captain Osorio (a relation of Juan de Ampudia) and
others, agreed to leave Popayán for the new kingdom with merchandize,
horses, mares, slaves, and much worked silver. With these goods, which
amounted to a great money value, they left Popayán and set out on the
road for Bogotá, without distrusting the Indians, because, as it was
peace time, they had no fear of hostilities with them. They went on
until they arrived in the country of the _Yalcones_, which borders on
that of Páez. At this time the captain Pedro de Añasco had left Timaná
to go to Popayán, to trade for horses and other things he required.
He came to the country of the Yalcones, which is where I have said
Osorio had arrived. The natives of that region are numerous and
determined. They fight with lances 30 _palmos_ long, and have other
formidable weapons. They resolved to rebel against the Spaniards,
and not merely to refuse obedience, but to kill the captain and the
others who had come from Popayán, As they had notice of the numerous
horses, mares, and other things the Spaniards brought, they desired
to put their thought into execution to satiate their cursed bellies
with human flesh, and to rob what we have said. They took up arms with
this intent, and planned that one party should attack the captain
Pedro de Añasco, while another fell upon the Christians who had come
from Popayán, for they feared that if they did not adopt this division
of force, their plan might not succeed. The Indians were upon all
the hills, but they repaired with feigned friendliness to the ravine
of _Apirimá_ (which is the locality where Osorio was) to put the
Spaniards off their guard.

At this time the captain Pedro de Añasco had arrived at a valley
called _Ayunga_. When the Indians formed the intention already stated,
it came to the knowledge of a friendly Chief who was with Añasco. This
Chief told Añasco of the league formed by the Yalcones, those of Páez,
and other neighbouring tribes, and that, as he had only two horses, he
had better go back. The captain made light of what the Chief had told
him, showing that he thought little of it, and he continued on until
he came to a building, late in the day, where two Indians appeared.
One brought a young lion, dead and putrid, for the captain to eat,
the other brought some cobs of young maize. The captain, seeing the
presents, knew what they signified, and the Indians, dissembling, said
that presently, the next day, they would bring those who would eat the
captain and his Christians. The friendly Chief then spoke to Pedro de
Añasco urging him to return into the forest, which was not far from
there, and he would be safe from the Indians. But he would not go
back because he did not believe that the audacity of the barbarians
could reach to such a point. He ordered all his men to be ready with
their arms, and that some of them should keep watch on the roads
leading to the buildings where they were encamped, which was done. The
Indians had gathered in a great mass and, before dawn, they attacked
the Spanish sentries with a violent clamour. Although the sentries
behaved as Spaniards always do, they were overpowered, killed, cut in
pieces, and carried away to be eaten. The captain, Pedro de Añasco,
hearing the noise, commended himself to God, and mounted his horse.
With his companions he then awaited the Indians' onslaught, his men
animating each other. Añasco was a well-grown man of fine presence,
one of the principal knights of Seville; but for his sins, or by God's
permission, he came at last to a most cruel and unworthy death, for
such a warrior.

The Indians, in much confusion, had already rushed upon the
Spaniards, when the captain, and Baltasar del Rio charged them with
their horses. Though the Spaniards showed great determination, they
could not prevail against such a bevy of lances as faced their horses;
nevertheless Pedro de Añasco broke into them, while the other horseman
was killed. The captain, whose horse came out wounded and bridleless,
turned again to attack the enemy with his blood-covered lance, but
they fell upon him in such numbers that, after having killed the
horse, they captured him alive. The rest of the Spaniards were all
either killed or frightfully wounded, some of them having their bodies
so full of lances that nothing could be seen but the wooden staves.
Others fell wounded and were promptly despatched. Others had their
eyes or their tongues torn out, or were impaled. Two Spaniards, one
named Cornejo and the other Mideros, resisted so valiantly that, after
having fought against the multitude of savages, they sallied forth
from that place in spite of them all, and, with their swiftness of
foot, ran off in the direction of Timaná. For four days they wandered
without food except some wild herbs, pursued by the Indians, suffering
other great hardships and many times surrounded, until by God's
pleasure they got free and made for Timaná, where the death of Pedro
de Añasco had already been rumoured, and Pedro de Guzmán de Herrera
had gone forth with three horsemen to find out whether it was true.
One night, when the party were asleep, the Indians attacked them. They
mounted their horses in great haste. Pedro de Guzmán was getting on
his, but as they did not leave him time to cast off the halter, and
the horse was unable to start, he was killed with many lance wounds.
The other Spaniards, though in great danger, escaped to Timaná.

Captain Osorio was, as we have said, in the ravine of Apirimá with
those who had come with him, numbering sixteen Spaniards. From his
camp to where Añasco's people were massacred, was not more than two
leagues. Just as they were about to resume their journey, the great
mass of Indians rushed upon them, after having eaten the bodies of all
the Spaniards they had killed, and robbed all the baggage. They had
taken the captain Pedro de Añasco alive. He was sent all through the
province, that he might be seen in the market places and villages,
where the people heaped insults upon the unhappy captain and made his
body suffer a thousand martyrdoms. They killed him by a lingering and
cruel death. On one day they cut off an arm, on another they tore out
an eye, on the next they cut off his lips, and so they continued to
consume the being that had been a man, until life was ended, when the
body found sepulture in the bellies of his murderers.

The savages, having next arrived at Apirimá, where the Christians
who had gone to Popayán were encamped, encircled them, and then,
with great clamour, attacked them suddenly and began to wound them.
Although the Spaniards attempted a defence they could not prevail.
Only one escaped, a Spaniard whose name was Serrano. All the rest were
killed and eaten by the Indians, who also captured the merchandize
and other things which were intended for sale at Bogotá. After they
had killed the Spaniards and seized all their property the Indians
returned to their villages very pleased with themselves.

                             CHAPTER XIII

   _How, when the death of the Spaniards was known at Popayán, the
   captain Juan de Ampudia set out from thence, and how he and
   other Christians were killed by the same Indians._


When the Indians had returned to their villages, as we related in the
last chapter, they had great banquets and drinking orgies. It was
agreed by them that if any Spaniards should come against them from
Popayán and Timaná, they would kill them all, or do to them as they
had done to Pedro de Añasco. As soon as this was settled they made
great trenches and walls for defence, cutting the hills where the
roads led, and using haste to make arms.

When Serrano arrived at Popayán and told the captain Juan de Ampudia
the fate of the Spaniards, he was much distressed and determined to
make war on the murderers. He took from Popayán sixty Spaniards, horse
and foot, as well armed as was possible, with what cross-bows there
were, and very fierce dogs. He left Popayán and marched until he came
to a province called _Guanaca_. Thence he approached the Yalcones,
and arrived near Apirimá, the scene of the death of Osorio and his
party. As soon as the Indians knew of his arrival, they stationed
themselves on the heights, waiting in ambush to kill the invaders.
Two of the Indians having shown themselves, however, the captain sent
Antonio Redondo, a citizen of Cali, with ten Spaniards to try and
capture them. But when Antonio reached the place where they had been
seen, a great force of the enemy burst into view and attacked his ten
men, so that the Spaniards turned and fled, not stopping until they
got to where the captain had halted. The Indians overtook one, named
Paredes, and killed him. When Juan de Ampudia saw this, he came to the
rescue with the rest of his force and attacked the Indians in such
sort that they impaled many with their lances, while the Spaniards on
foot killed even more with swords and cross-bows. The killed were so
numerous that a stream which ran down the ravine became the colour of
blood.

The Indians, astounded at the turn of events, fled to escape from
the dogs, which tore their flesh, and many threw themselves over the
crags. The victory was with the Spaniards, and a Chief was captured.
He told the captain Juan de Ampudia that the Indians were strongly
entrenched and had cut the roads. The captain assured him of his life,
and told him that he must guide them by a safe track; and that for
doing so he would be in no danger. The barbarian promised, and so they
set out from that place with the captive Indian as a guide, wishing
to reach the summit of the pass. The Indians had united from many
parts, and all, with long lances, slings, and other arms, prepared
to deal death to the Christians, assuming that they could do it very
easily, and making a great yelling. The Spaniards continued to ascend
the range, Captain Francisco García de Tovar, being in front with
the infantry. Indians appeared in all directions and inquired of the
Spaniards whether they were fat, as they were going to eat both them
and their horses. Juan de Ampudia and Luis Bernal placed themselves
on the height. Hernán Sánchez Morillo and others on horseback missed
the track, but, though with much difficulty, they gained the summit,
which had already been reached by those on foot. One and all then
commended themselves to God, and calling on the apostle St. James to
help them, attacked the Indians, being only the number I have stated
against 4,000 Indians. After the battle had continued for a long time,
the ground being covered with dead and wounded Indians--for only
one Christian was killed and very few were wounded--the barbarians,
amazed at the strength of the Spaniards, abandoned the field and began
to flee. The Christians were so exhausted and fatigued that they
could scarcely stand on their feet. There they passed the night. The
Indians, joined by others from all parts, came near to the Spaniards'
bivouac and, by the advice of some of the latter, the captain Tovar
with forty shield and cross-bow men, went forth to attack those
who were nearest. The Indians waited and attacked the Spaniards in
front, giving a terrific shout. Those who are not accustomed to hear
this clamour often lose their presence of mind, and commit very ugly
faults. But Tovar and his companions fought well, killing and wounding
many. The Indians said that all had to be eaten that night. Showing
his face and commanding person, Tovar exclaimed: "Dogs! I am Francisco
García de Tovar, and with me and not with others have ye to do."
Then, by the marvellous valour of this captain and the Spaniards his
companions, they did such deeds that a great number of Indians were
killed, the rest fled, and Tovar returned to the captain, who received
him with welcome.

Soon afterwards Juan de Ampudia marched down the mountain side, with
all the Spaniards, to some buildings, where they encamped. Francisco
García de Tovar, with a guard, entered first and found that there were
no Indians; because, when they escaped from him, they had fled to
where the principal Chiefs of the Yalcones and of Páez were waiting to
collect more Indians. They sent a message to the Christians, calling
upon them to leave their country, for that, as their fathers had left
it free they ought not to seek to usurp it nor to deprive them of
their ancient liberty. If they refused, they would be treated like
Pedro de Añasco and the other Spaniards who were killed. The captain
replied that they must render obedience to his Majesty, and that then
he would presently leave their province and return to Popayán. When
these conferences were finished and the messengers had departed, the
captain, seeing how much work the men had done, and how tired they
all were, besides being very few to make war against so many Indians,
especially such a daring pack, decided to return to Popayán, and to
punish the province of Páez, which was also up in arms, on his way.
So they got ready to depart. When about to start Francisco García de
Tovar said to the captain, Ampudia, that it would be very desirable
to gain the summit of the pass, to prevent the Indians from occupying
it, lest they pelt them with their darts and stones. Juan de Ampudia
concurred, and ordered all to be prepared, while some young men went
on to gain the pass. As some of the Spaniards had stayed behind with
a horse that was knocked up, they were told to wait there and that,
if they could not arrive while yet day, they were to sleep there
that night. When it was late these Spaniards arrived with the horse
cut up in pieces for eating. Juan de Ampudia told them to go to some
declivities which were in front of where they were.

Francisco García de Tovar again urged that they should occupy the
summit, for otherwise they would be in great danger; and he took the
fact that they had not seen a single Indian that day to be a bad sign.
When Francisco García de Tovar said this, the Spaniards were making
their way towards the slopes and level spaces near there: but Juan de
Ampudia saying "Let us go where I said, for it is only a short way
off" they went on contrary to the advice of Tovar. They moved off in
very great sadness, for neither did the men speak, nor the horses
neigh, nor the dogs bark. As they marched thus they heard a great
yelling of the Indians who, when they saw the route the Spaniards were
taking, rejoiced because they felt sure they would kill and eat them
all; having a great quantity of huge stones to roll down, which they
had collected on the summit. As soon as the Spaniards had reached
the declivities, the Indians began to hurl down so many and such
large stones that the former, from fear of them, divided themselves
into four or five parties. Then the Indians renewed their terrible
yelling, hurled their darts, and asked if the Spaniards were nice and
fat, for none of them would escape death. Juan de Ampudia and Tovar
went together, telling Hernán Sánchez Morillo to go with the horses
until he could get clear of the declivity. At this time the Indians
came down to attack the Spaniards, who, though divided and in such
small numbers, fought with a valour and desperation that can scarcely
be believed. But God was with them and on their side, and this
being so they performed such famous deeds as these we relate, and
others greater, as indeed they always do. After they had killed many
Indians, they saw that the others were taking fright at what they had
witnessed, and the horsemen, having got over a difficult pass, were in
a position to join in the assault against the Indians and help their
own companions.

Francisco García de Tovar received three wounds, and he and Juan de
Ampudia had managed to keep together with sixteen other Spaniards.
After having defeated the Indians who first came down, they set off to
repel another large batch of them. Although the Spaniards fought as at
first, and killed some of the enemy with cross-bows, yet the Indians
were so numerous that by no manner of means could the foot-soldiers
advance. They had to retreat and join the horsemen who were now
nearing them. While they were doing this the captain Juan de Ampudia,
being a fleshy man, could not keep up with the others. The Indians
overtook him and pierced his body with many lances, so that he died in
great misery. They stripped the body, without even leaving his linen
drawers. Juan de Ampudia was a native of Jerez de la Frontera. Then
the horsemen came up and inflicted great loss on the Indians. They
gained the summit and called on the rest of the Spaniards to come up,
as there was nothing to fear. All who had come with Juan de Ampudia
were wounded or quite worn out, as the reader may easily imagine. With
much trouble they all assembled on the heights, and greatly did they
rejoice at seeing themselves there, embracing each other as if they
had not met for many days. The only killed were Juan de Ampudia and
one other Spaniard, besides a _Morisca_ and a few friendly Indians of
our party.

Then there was a fresh attack by more than twenty thousand Indian
warriors, with the intention of killing all the Spaniards and
finishing them. Seeing this state of affairs, after having cast
the body of Juan de Ampudia into a river, to prevent the Indians
from eating it, they determined to return to Popayán. In order that
the Indians might think they were still there, they left the tents
standing and tied some of the dogs to poles, that the Indians, hearing
them barking, might have no suspicion that their masters had gone. And
so it was. They fled with such speed that they covered in that one
night what it had taken them four days to do, in coming. Next day,
though the Indians followed, they could not overtake them. And so they
marched until they arrived at Popayán, where there was great grief for
the death of the good and brave captain Juan de Ampudia.




                             CHAPTER XIV

   _How the Adelantado Don Pascual de Andagoya entered the cities,
   and was received by them as Governor._


Here I would have concluded my account of the events which occurred
in this province, in order to turn the narrative to what happened to
the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro; but it will tend to the clearness
of both the one subject and the other if I write touching the
arrival of Andagoya. Let the reader remember that we mentioned that
officer's arrival at Panamá, and that his Majesty appointed him to
the government of the Rio de San Juan, which is in the land of Tierra
Firme on the confines of Peru; and that, notwithstanding his Majesty's
order that he was not to encroach upon any tract settled or explored
by any of the captains of the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro, he did
that same, although it was in disobedience to the royal command. At
that time the port of Buenaventura was scarcely discovered. So he
took experienced pilots with him who, by their art, might seek a
port by which to enter that land. With the people he had assembled,
he left Panamá and sailed on until he arrived at the Isle of Palms.
After some things that happened, his ships entered a bay into which
many rivers which rose in the mountains emptied themselves. From the
position of the harbour, the opinion was that the city of Cali would
be found inland. So he began to travel by one of the roughest and most
difficult roads that is to be found in any part of the world. After
having suffered great hardships, and lost all the horses, he reached
the city of Cali and was well received by the inhabitants. Andagoya
presented the commission he brought with him, declaring that he came
to do much good and to maintain justice for all. After reading it, but
without asking to see his instructions, nor considering that there was
no river called after San Juan in that land, they received Andagoya as
Governor and Captain-general: in which they acted very foolishly.

As soon as the Adelantado had been received at Cali, he heard of the
captain Jorge Robledo's mission to explore, and also that he had
founded a city in Anzerma. So he sent Miguel Muñoz to take possession
of that city in his name, and ordered its designation to be changed
from Santa Ana to _San Juan_. He also sent to take possession of
Popayán, and was acknowledged without any opposition in that city. He
wrote to Robledo by Miguel Muñoz, making him great offers. When Muñoz
arrived at Anzerma, and presented the Adelantado's commissions, he was
acknowledged there as he had been in Cali. He heard from the Indians
that Robledo, and we who were with him, were not far off, having
passed the river; and on receipt of this news many wrote letters
giving an account of what was happening. Miguel Muñoz returned to give
an account to Andagoya of what he had done on his behalf. The latter,
feeling that the way in which he had occupied the cities did not leave
him secure, and fearing that Belalcázar, who had peopled and founded
them, would return to them as Governor, made great haste to collect
evidence and witnesses against the latter, believing that in this way
he would discomfit Belalcázar, and that his Majesty and the members
of his Council would confer no favours on him. Leaving the Adelantado
busy with these intrigues, we will return to Robledo, and tell how he
explored the province of _Quinbaya_ and founded the city of Cartago
there.




                              CHAPTER XV

   _How the captain Jorge Robledo explored the province of
   Quinbaya, and how he founded the city of Cartago._


Robledo was sufficiently informed, in the province of Carrapa, that
Quinbaya was large and full of very rich Chiefs and lords. As he was
desirous of forming another new settlement where he could divide the
districts among the Spaniards who were serving with him, he asked the
Indians of Carrapa to supply him with what was necessary. When he
was ready he set out and marched until he reached the borders of the
province of Quinbaya. As all that region is full of large and very
thick cane brakes, and the Spaniards did not see any large villages
like those they had passed, they became very despondent and said that
it would have been better to have settled in the countries they had
passed, since they were more profitable. The captain replied to those
who said this that he would be delighted to do as they wished, and
that presently they would return. So the men began to prepare for
going back. The captain then intended to send and make a settlement
in the region of Arma, entrusting the service to his ensign Suer de
Nava, while he himself would return to the city of Santa Ana, the name
of which Andagoya had ordered to be changed to San Juan. But there
were not wanting those who murmured at these changes of plan. They
said that the best course to pursue would be to pass through the cane
brakes, and see what lay beyond them. So after discussing both schemes
the captain ordered the ensign Suer de Nava to go forward with forty
Spaniards, and force a way through those cane brakes and dense wilds.

When it became known in all that country that the Spaniards were there
the Chiefs were so luxurious and vicious that not only did they make
no resistance, but they decided to go to the Chief of the Spaniards
with presents of gold, thinking that he would then pass on. One of
them, named _Tacurumbi_ came to where the captain was, bringing a
piece of gold which weighed more than 700 _pesos_; with other very
rich vases of gold and finely wrought pieces. The Spaniards rejoiced
greatly at the arrival of this Chief because he told of the riches
there were among them. Those who had gone with Suer de Nava came back
asking for rewards for their news of the land they had discovered,
which was to the effect that they came to many dwellings of Chiefs,
in which were plenty of supplies, and they saw large villages and
groves of trees, and all the countryside as far as the great valley of
Cali. The captain went to join Suer de Nava, and from all parts of the
province came Chiefs with quantities of gold, which, with what more he
had had, he appropriated for himself without any other law empowering
him to do so than the forcefulness and strength which captains then
possessed, and are marks of great tyranny. After having taken stock
of the villages in the land, he determined to found a city there and
to give it all he had discovered, for its jurisdiction. He personally
selected a site in the position which seemed most convenient, and
thus in the year 1540 he founded the city of _Cartago_ in the name of
the Emperor Don Carlos, and the royal crown of Castille, and of the
Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro, Governor of all the provinces of Peru.
He gave that name to the city because all we who were engaged in
that expedition called ourselves _Cartagineses_, having come from the
prefecture of Cartagena. Pero López Patiño and Martín de Arriaga were
appointed _alcaldes_.

As soon as he had completed the founding of Cartago, the captain left
his ensign Suer de Nava as his lieutenant there, and decided to go to
Anzerma and Cali to see the Adelantado Andagoya, for by letters, and
from a Spaniard named Alonso de Ortega, he heard about all that was
happening. He had been much grieved at the news of the deaths of Juan
de Ampudia and of Pedro de Añasco, and of Pedro de Guzmán de Herrera,
with whom he had been on terms of great friendship.




                             CHAPTER XVI

   _How the captain Jorge de Robledo left the city of Cartago
   and went to Cali, where he was well received, and returned as
   Captain and Lieutenant-general of the cities he had founded._


Having decided to return to Anzerma and to go and see Andagoya, the
captain left Cartago, after having arranged several things with Suer
de Nava. He travelled until he arrived at Anzerma, where he learnt
what had been taking place, and that some of the settlers had worked
against him. Concealing his anger for the time, he went on to Cali
(where the Adelantado was) accompanied by a dozen or so Spaniards.
When he came near the city he sent a soldier on with the news. As
soon as the Adelantado heard it, he rejoiced and ordered that Robledo
should have a great reception. That captain, having as little guile
as the others, not only offered to accept the Adelantado as Governor
of all the cities he had founded, but sent him 4,000 _pesos_ of gold,
part of the ornaments he had received during his conquests, and
divided a larger quantity among other persons. Andagoya, to make his
friendship more secure, married him to a relation of his wife. After
he had been at Cali some days, Robledo departed for the city of Santa
Ana, or San Juan as it was now called, accompanied by us and those who
had come with him. Having settled certain affairs there, and leaving
Ruy Vanegas as his lieutenant, he went back to Cartago to make the
_repartimiento_. He found that there had been some dissensions between
the _alcaldes_ and the lieutenant he had left there. They were of a
trifling character, but taking them as if they concerned himself, he
arrested the _alcaldes_. Having arrived at the city he acknowledged
Andagoya as Governor, and turned his attention to the pacification of
the natives.

He then sent Alvaro de Mendoza, with some Spaniards on foot, to
see what lay on the other side of the snowy cordillera of the Andes.
Arrived at the summit, they saw roads which crossed the opposite
river-valley, but considering that a further advance could not be
made without horses, they returned. Captain Robledo then turned his
attention to settling the _repartimiento_ among the Spaniards who were
there. We will now revert to the proceedings of the Marquis, and leave
this part of the history until the coming of the Governor Belalcázar.




                             CHAPTER XVII

   _Of what passed in the city of Los Reyes, and how the Marquis
   Don Francisco Pizarro, with the concurrence of the Bishop Friar
   Vicente de Valverde, made the general repartimiento: and the
   departure of Gómez de Alvarado to form a settlement at Guanuco._


During the time that the Marquis Don Francisco Pizarro was absent from
the city of Los Reyes, the natives not being yet quite subdued, nor
having given up the hope of regaining their ancient liberty by killing
the Spaniards, two principal citizens of Lima, named Francisco de
Vargas (a native of Campos) and Sebastian de Torres, who held an
_encomienda_ in the province of Guaraz, being at Guaylas, with some
others, were killed by the Indians. When this was known at Lima,
captain Francisco de Chaves[26] [the good] went to punish the Indians,
with the approval of the municipality and judicial authorities, taking
a sufficient force of horse and foot. They laid waste the fields and
villages of the natives, because they were found up in arms. The war
made by the Spaniards was so cruel that the Indians, fearing lest
they should all be killed, prayed for peace. This was granted by the
captain Francisco de Chaves, who thought he had done harm enough. The
war being ended he returned to Lima.

At this time the Marquis had founded the cities of Guamanga and
Arequipa, and had visited all the provinces of the Collao. He was so
much fatigued that he was glad to return to Lima where, after some
days, he resolved to make a general _repartimiento_, with the consent
and concurrence of the Bishop, Valverde, because such had been the
order of his Majesty.

They both, the Bishop and the Marquis, swore solemnly to make the
_repartimiento_ with all fidelity, without considering anything but
the service that each man had performed. But though they took this
oath, there were some who said that they kept it badly, because they
left many conquerors and explorers poor and in want, while they gave
to many of their servants the best and richest of the _repartimientos_.

As the Marquis had founded the cities we have mentioned, and
considered it desirable that one should be founded in the province
of Guanuco, he presently determined to give orders with that object.
Looking round to select a captain to perform this service, he
concluded that Gómez de Alvarado, brother of Don Pedro, would do it
well, while it would offer a means to gain his friendship; and it
might even furnish an opening for those of Chile[27] to lose the
hatred they felt against the Marquis owing to past differences.
So the Marquis sent for Gómez de Alvarado, and told him that he
had determined to found a city in the province of Guanuco, that he
should have the _repartimiento_ of Indians there, and offered him the
appointment. Gómez de Alvarado, seeing the delay there was in Spain
in providing for justice, and not being able maintain himself, but
now in actual need, replied to the Marquis that he would do what he
ordered. When the magistrates and settlers in Lima understood that the
Marquis intended to found a city at Guanuco, they protested that it
was not just to so curtail the extent of their jurisdiction. Already
Guamanga had been taken from them. They told the Marquis further that
he could not order such a settlement to be made in those provinces,
since they belonged to their city. But this did not prevent him from
despatching the captain Gómez de Alvarado with the people who wished
to go with him, among them being some from Chile, friends of his who
had been old soldiers in Peru. With these he set out for Guanuco,
and in the locality which appeared most suitable for maintaining a
new population, he founded the city, naming Diego de Caravajal and
Rodrigo Núñez, formerly the Camp-master of Almagro the elder, to be
its _alcaldes_. The people of Lima did not cease to complain, urging
that the extent of their jurisdiction should not be curtailed. It came
to such a pitch that the Marquis was induced to abandon the title of
"city," and give the new settlement the name of "town," to be subject
to Lima. When Gómez de Alvarado learnt this, he came from the new city
or town of Guanuco to Lima with the determination not to return to it
unless it were ordered to be called a city.

Further on we will relate what happened afterwards at Guanuco, for
all that was done by Gómez de Alvarado counted for nothing; and the
Marquis ordered one Pedro Barroso to take charge of the affairs of
that province. At this time the men of the Almagro party were in sore
straits. They wandered in the Indian villages to get something to eat,
barely clothed and in great misery. As they all knew that Don Diego
was in Lima, they came down from Charcas, Arequipa, and Cuzco to seek
him, saying that his Majesty was treating them badly, in not sending
out a judge against the Marquis. Those of the party who were in Lima
were not in less necessity than those who were away. For some time
before this the Marquis had directed Don Diego to leave his house,[28]
and though he afterwards sojourned in the house of Francisco de
Chaves, he was also sent away from thence. Juan de Herrada and Juan
Balsa sought him out. There arrived to join him thirty or forty of
those who had followed the Adelantado, old yeomen of his father, and
they too suffered great want. The Governor ordered nothing for their
sustenance nor did he remember that without Almagro he would not have
been what he was, nor would he have attained at the command he then
held. Those of the Almagro party endured their squalid condition as
best they could.

At that time there were in the city of Lima the captains Juan de
Sayavedra, Francisco de Chaves, Cristóbal de Sotelo, Saucedo, Juan de
Herrada, Don Alonso de Montemayor, and the accountant Juan de Guzmán,
besides other old friends of the Adelantado. Juan de Herrada employed
himself in contriving how they and Don Diego could be maintained. It
happened that there was only one cloak among ten or twelve of them,
and when one went out with it on, the others remained indoors, so that
the cloak was always in use. Besides those who arrived to join Don
Diego he had other friends in the city, but there was not found one
citizen who had the charity or the will to give them anything to eat.
No one would maintain the youth Don Diego, nor those who were with
him, excepting one Domingo de la Presa, who put a small village near
the city at their disposal, the Indians of which provided them with
maize, firewood, and other necessaries. We will leave off writing of
the men of Chile until the time came when they slew the Marquis, and
we will say how the factor Illán Suárez de Caravajal got word that
these men of Chile had come to Lima, where it might be they would
plot something not for the well-being of the Marquis. This factor
wrote a letter in cypher and sent it. This made it necessary for the
licentiate Benito Suárez to explain the contents of the letter.[29]
He told the Marquis that his brother the factor advised him, in that
letter, to be on his guard lest the men of Chile kill him; and to
be careful of his person, because many were coming from Charcas,
Arequipa, and Cuzco to join with Don Diego. Although the Marquis
received this information, he took no steps nor did he place any guard
over his person. He made Dr. Blázquez his lieutenant, in succession to
Francisco de Chaves, who had held the post up to that time.

The captain Alonso de Alvarado arrived from Chachapoyas, and had some
words with Francisco de Chaves and Gómez de Alvarado in the presence
of the Marquis. It came to such a pass that Alonso de Alvarado and
Gómez de Alvarado challenged each other and took the field. When the
Marquis heard of it he interfered and induced these two captains to
make peace. He looked on Alonso de Alvarado with much favour, as his
own captain and the founder of the city of La Frontera.[30] With
permission of the Marquis he returned to that city.

FOOTNOTES:

[26] There were two captains of the name Francisco de Chaves, believed
to be cousins. They should not be confused together. One was a very
distinguished officer, a friend of the Marquis Pizarro but not
ignoring his faults. He was murdered by Juan de Herrada and the other
assassins of Pizarro. The other was one of Almagro's captains, also
murdered by Juan de Herrada on account of a private quarrel. For
distinction I call one Francisco de Chaves (the good) and the other
Francisco de Chaves (the bad).

[28] The Marquis had received young Diego Almagro most hospitably in
his own house, where he was lodged as a guest for months. His conduct
must have been very disreputable, to have made the Marquis send him
away to the care of Francisco de Chaves. Cieza de León says that he
was addicted to the vices of his countrymen.

                            CHAPTER XVIII

   _How, after Gonzalo Pizarro was received as Governor of Quito,
   he determined to undertake the conquest of El Dorado; and of his
   departure from Quito._


We have already related, in a former chapter, how the Marquis Pizarro
ordered the captain Gonzalo Pizarro, his brother, to depart for the
city of Quito, where, by virtue of an authority from his Majesty, he
would be received as Governor. In reality the authority was not to
the effect that the Marquis could divide the government; still less
did it empower him, if it should seem to him fit, to grant the whole
to one of his brothers or to any one he chose. The aim of the Marquis
was to establish his brother in that province, that his Majesty might
not grant the government of it to Belalcázar, whose setting out by
the Rio Grande was now known.[31] Although this was so, they say that
the Marquis wrote to His Majesty that, if it were decided to divide
the government, Belalcázar deserved whatever favour might be shown
him. News also came to Lima that Pascual de Andagoya was coming as
Governor of the province of the river of San Juan. This caused the
Marquis great annoyance, and he appointed one Isidro de Tapia to be
his lieutenant at Cali, nay, also at Anzerma, in consequence, it is
said, of heavy bribes given to the Secretary Antonio Picado. Although
this was done, they would not accept him nor give up Robledo in his
stead.

To return to Gonzalo Pizarro. He arrived at the city of Quito, where
he found Lorenzo de Aldana, and by virtue of the authority we have
mentioned, they received him as Governor of Quito, San Miguel, Puerto
Viejo, Guayaquil and Pasto. Soon afterwards Pedro de Puelles, who had
been the Governor's lieutenant at Quito, arrived on the sea coast.

Now Gonzalo Pizarro was desirous of undertaking some expedition,
and observing in that city of Quito many men, all either youths or
veterans, he became eager for the discovery of the valley of _El
Dorado_, based on the same story which the captains Pedro de Añasco
and Belalcázar had brought, and on what was said of the land of
Cinnamon which, a short time before, had been invaded by the captain
Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda. This Pineda, with a party of Spaniards,
penetrated as far as some very lofty mountains, but many Indians
came from their lower slopes to prevent the Spaniards from advancing
further. These Indians killed some of the Spaniards, and amongst
them a cleric. They had made many trenches and ditches. Pineda's
party advanced for some days until they came to the _Quijos_, and the
Cinnamon valley. They returned to Quito without having been able to
fully explore the region of which they had heard such great things.
The Indians said that further on, if they advanced, they would come to
a widespreading flat country, teeming with Indians who possess great
riches, for they all wear gold ornaments, and where are no forests
nor mountain ranges.[32] When this news was spread in Quito, every
one who was there wanted to take part in the expedition. The Governor
Gonzalo Pizarro began to make preparations and collect men and horses.
In a few days he got together 220 Spaniards, horse and foot,[33]
naming Don Antonio de Rivera to be Camp-master, and Juan de Acosta
Ensign-general. As soon as the men of the expedition had been mustered
Gonzalo Pizarro ordered Don Antonio de Rivera to go forward with the
vanguard. Don Antonio replied that he would do so gladly, and all got
ready to start. In the city of Quito, Pedro de Puelles remained as
Lieutenant and Chief Justice. They started well equipped, and with
plenty of provisions.[34] The natives of Quito, on seeing them pass
beyond their domains, declared that they would find great riches, and
praised the land of which news had been brought; while the Spaniards
already imagined the plunder before their eyes, and believed it theirs.

                             CHAPTER XIX

   _How Gonzalo Pizarro left the city of Quito for the land of
   Cinnamon, which was one of the most laborious explorations that
   have been made in the mainland or the South Sea._


This exploration and conquest by Gonzalo Pizarro, we are bound to
say, was the most laborious expedition that has been undertaken in
these Indies, in which the Spaniards endured great hardships, famine,
and miseries, which well tried the virtues of their nation, like
similar events that have occurred in these parts of the world. It is
known to all that many nations have excelled others and made them
tributaries, and the few have conquered the many. Thus they say of
Alexander the Great that, with thirty-three thousand Macedonians, he
undertook to conquer the world. So with the Romans: many of their
captains who were sent to make war in the provinces attacked their
enemies with so few men that it is ridiculous to think of. And as I
now have to describe in my history some examples which reflect praise
on my nation, I appeal to what will be written, where the curious can
see like myself. I mean that no other race can be found which can
penetrate through such rugged lands, such dense forests, such great
mountains and deserts, and over such broad rivers, as the Spaniards
have done without help from others, solely by the valour of their
persons and the forcefulness of their breed. In a period of seventy
years they have overcome and opened up another world, greater than the
one of which we had knowledge, without bringing with them waggons of
provisions, nor great store of baggage, nor tents in which to rest,
nor anything but a sword and a shield, and a small bag in which they
carried their food. Thus it was that they went forth to explore that
which was unknown and never before seen. And this is what I think of
the Spaniards, and I esteem them because, until now, no other race
or nation has, with such resolution, passed through such labours, or
such long periods of starvation, or traversed such long distances as
they have.[35] At least I have found none. And in this expedition of
Gonzalo Pizarro assuredly very great hardships were experienced.

Having decided to send the Camp-master Don Antonio de Rivera on in
front, Gonzalo Pizarro gave orders for him to make straight for the
province of _Quijos_. He started at once, and after a few days Gonzalo
Pizarro did the same, Cristóbal de Funes going in command of the
rear-guard. Don Antonio advanced to a place called _Hatunquijo_.
Gonzalo Pizarro followed. At this time, just when the enterprise of
Gonzalo Pizarro became known on the coast of Peru, there arrived one
Francisco de Orellana, a native of the city of Truxillo, with thirty
Spaniards, and he set out to follow Gonzalo Pizarro, who had already
left Quito. Gonzalo crossed a range of mountains, where there were
snowy alps, and here over a hundred Indian men and women were frozen
to death. Though the Spaniards suffered much from the cold, none of
them died. From thence they traversed a very rugged country full of
rivers, and with forest lands well peopled. They advanced through
these dense forests, opening a road with axes and wood knives; and
so they marched until they came to the valley of _Zumaque_,[36]
which they found well peopled and amply stocked with provisions. It
is thirty leagues from Quito. Orellana, as we have said, followed
Gonzalo Pizarro over those thirty leagues between Quito and Zumaque,
and both he and his followers suffered much from hunger, owing to so
many people having passed just before. After several days they reached
Zumaque, where Pizarro was with all his party. Pizarro received them
with hearty welcome, and appointed this Francisco de Orellana to be
his Lieutenant-general. Before he had arrived at Zumaque, Gonzalo
Pizarro had ordered his Camp-master Don Antonio to send Orellana some
provisions, for he was in much need. Don Antonio told off the captain
Sancho de Caravajal to convey the succour of provisions, and so enable
Orellana to arrive. Sancho de Caravajal presently started back to meet
him, and when Orellana's party saw him they rejoiced at the sight, and
still more at the food he brought, of which they were in much need.
They all then marched to Zumaque, where the things happened that we
have related.

After the arrival of Orellana, Gonzalo Pizarro entered into
consultation with his principal officers, as to the next step that
should be taken. Orellana and his party had arrived very tired. But
the rest had been some while at Zumaque and it was time to continue
the advance. It was decided that Gonzalo Pizarro should go forward
and explore, and that Orellana should follow, after a few days, with
the rest of the expedition. Gonzalo Pizarro was only to take seventy
Spaniards, without any horses, because the country was so rough and
difficult that horses could not be used. Leaving all the horses in the
camp at Zumaque Gonzalo Pizarro set out with seventy odd Spaniards,
among them being some cross-bow men and arquebusiers. They took a
route in the direction of sunrise, having local Indians with them as
guides. They started and marched for several days through dense and
rugged forest country until they came to where the trees they call
_canelos_ grow, and which are like big olive-trees, and bear large
flowers and pods.[37] This is the cinnamon of the most perfect kind,
and of much substance. No other trees like these have been met with
in all the regions of the Indies. The natives value them highly, and
in all their settlements they trade with this cinnamon. There are
some Indians in these forests, and they live in small, badly built
huts, apart from each other. They are very brutish and without reason,
usually have many wives, and move through these forests so easily that
it is astounding to see their agility.

When Gonzalo Pizarro arrived where these _canelos_ grow, he took
certain Indians as guides and asked where there were valleys and
plains with many of these trees yielding cinnamon. The Indians replied
that they did not know of any others than these, and that they had
not seen them anywhere else. Gonzalo Pizarro also tried to learn from
these Indians the character of the country in front, whether the
forests came to an end, and whether he would soon emerge into open
country, and well-peopled provinces. They answered again that they
knew nothing, because they were so hemmed in by other tribes that,
except with a few who lived in the recesses of the forest, they had no
truck; adding that the Spaniards might chance, on going forward, to
find some Indians of those parts who would travel with them and guide
them to where they desired to go. Gonzalo Pizarro was angry that the
Indians had given no reply in conformity with what he wanted. Turning
to ask them other things, they answered all in the negative. So he
ordered some canes to be fixed across poles, like rather thin hurdles,
about three feet wide and seven in length, and the Indians to be put
on them and tortured until they told the truth. The innocent natives
were promptly stretched on these frames or barbecues, by the cruel
Spaniards, and some of them were burnt. As they did not understand
what the Spaniards said, nor could they see any just cause for being
cruelly put to death, they made great outcries and exclaimed with loud
and savage voices: "Why do you kill us with so little reason, neither
we nor our fathers have ever injured you. Do you want us to tell you
what we do not know?" and adding many other pitiful words, until the
fire penetrated and consumed their bodies. This butcher of a Gonzalo
Pizarro, not content with burning the Indians who had committed no
fault, further ordered that other Indians should be thrown to the
dogs, who tore them to pieces with their teeth and devoured them. I
heard that among those who were thus burnt or devoured, there were
some women, which made it worse. After Pizarro had killed these
Indians, he desired to get to some part where horses could be used.
For the Spaniards, who were with him, were discouraged at not finding
a land such as they wanted to see, and because the Indians did not
give them any information. Leaving that place they advanced until
they came to a river which formed a small beach of very level sand.
Here Gonzalo Pizarro ordered the camp to be pitched for that night,
to sleep. It rained so hard near the source of the river that a flood
came suddenly down and, if it had not been for warnings from the
sentries, some of the party would have been drowned by the rush of
water. Gonzalo Pizarro and those who were with him heard the cries of
the sentries and the noise of the waters, and they all rose up, and
took to their arms, thinking it was Indians coming to make war against
them. Seeing what had happened, they stationed themselves above some
wash-outs that were there and, although they used all the speed
possible, they lost some of their baggage. As they found themselves
driven from the place where they had formed their camp, and saw that
there was nothing but ranges of forest-clad and rugged mountains in
all directions, they decided to return by the way they came and see
if they could not find another track which would lead them in the
direction they wanted.

                              CHAPTER XX

   _How Gonzalo Pizarro left that river and went on exploring among
   those forests and hills without finding any large population,
   and how the whole party joined forces at a crossing over an arm
   of the Sweet Sea._[38]


Gonzalo Pizarro was much distressed at finding that he could not reach
any fertile and abundant province, beyond such rough country as he
had met with. He deplored, many times, that he had undertaken this
expedition. If he wanted to explore he might have done so from Cuzco
with better information, or from further south. But he did not let his
followers understand this. On the contrary he gave them all possible
encouragement, and it was the advice of all that they should return
towards the place whence they had started. On that same day they set
out, and returned towards Zumaque, stopping short at a distance of
four leagues from the camp. Gonzalo would not go into it, but ordered
his party to go direct to the village of _Ampua_. Before reaching
there they came to a great river which they could not ford.[39] The
Indians had canoes, and seeing some on the banks of the river, the
Spaniards called out saying that they came as friends, and that the
Indians need have no fear whatever. Their Chief, whose name was
_Delicola_, determined to go himself and see what manner of men had
invaded his country. So he came over, attended by fifteen or twenty
men. When Gonzalo Pizarro saw him, and knew that he was the lord of
that river where they were, he rejoiced and received him with much
honour, giving him some combs and knives, which they value highly. He
asked the Chief whether they knew of any land that was good, and to
which the Spaniards could go. Meanwhile the Chief had repented that he
had come as a friend, for he now got word of the many Indians put to
death by the Spaniards, because they had not given the pleasing news
the latter wished. So the Chief determined, though it was a lie, to
tell them that there were very great populations further on and very
rich regions full of powerful lords. Gonzalo Pizarro and his followers
were delighted to hear this, believing it to be all truth. Gonzalo
Pizarro ordered that the Spaniards were to watch this native Chief
without his knowing it, and look out for him in such a way as that it
would be impossible for him to escape. This was done, but the Chief,
guessing quite well that he was watched, dissembled and did not show
any anxiety. As the river was wide in that part and the canoes were
not there, they went on to see whether what this Indian had told them
was true or not, until they reached a place where the river became
narrow. Here they made a bridge and crossed over by it.

The wild mountaineers, when they knew of the Spaniards being in that
country, called many of their people together and, taking up arms,
collected on the other side of the river, where they dug trenches
and made forts to defend themselves. When Gonzalo Pizarro saw that,
he ordered some arquebusiers who were with him to fire off their
arquebuses and try to kill some of the natives. They did so, killing
six or seven Indians, whereupon the others, seeing the sudden deaths
of their companions, began to take to flight with loud yells. Having
crossed the river, the Spaniards came to a place where there were no
mountains, but low-lying plains, though presently these were seen to
be everywhere surrounded by forest. They found few natives and only a
small amount of provisions, all the Indians being of one appearance
and dress. So Gonzalo Pizarro decided to call up the rest of the
Spaniards, who were at Zumaque in the camp that was formed there.
Two Spaniards were sent for them and, on their arrival at Zumaque,
Don Antonio and the captain Orellana came to join Gonzalo Pizarro at
the place whence he had sent the message. When the whole expedition
was united, Gonzalo ordered the Camp-master, Don Antonio de Rivera,
to advance with some men, and find out what the country looked like
further on. Don Antonio set out with fifty Spaniards and marched
until he had covered about twenty leagues of upland. Then they came
upon a small settlement called _Barco_, and found some provisions. He
reported this to Gonzalo Pizarro who proceeded thither with his whole
force, the Chief meeting them in a friendly manner, and telling them
what was ahead. The natives were much alarmed at seeing the horses
and so many Spaniards. The Chief wanted to plunge into the river and
take to flight, but Sancho de Caravajal perceiving this, seized him
and brought him before Gonzalo Pizarro, who ordered him to be fastened
to a chain, with two other Chiefs who had come as friends. The Chief
who, we said, first gave them news of rich provinces was carefully
watched, but was not made a prisoner at that time. When the Indians
saw that their Chiefs who had come as friends had been put in chains
they were indignant, and, taking up arms, they came in forty canoes
direct to the place where they had seen their Chief who called to them
to protect him. But the Spaniards who saw the canoes coming and heard
the shouting, came out with their arms and put the Indians to rout.
Then Gonzalo Pizarro ordered Delicola, the Chief who had been a party
to raising the natives in arms against him and his followers, to be
made fast on the chain with the others.

The Spaniards, seeing that the river they had discovered was very
large and must flow down to the Sweet Sea,[40] and reflecting that of
all the servants they had brought from Quito not one remained, nor
could any be found where they were, the land being so bad, came to
the conclusion that the best plan would be to build a craft, on board
of which their supplies might go down the river, the horses following
by land, in the hope of reaching some region of plenty, for which
they all besought Our Lord. Presently they built the vessel with the
necessary outfit they had brought with them, and one Juan Alcántara
was given charge of her. They shipped as much stuff as she could stow,
and the Spaniards with the horses followed down stream, along the
bank. They met with some small settlements where they got maize and
_yuca_, and they found a quantity of guavas which afforded no small
help to them in their need. Continuing their journey down the river
bank, they sometimes wished to diverge in one direction or another to
see what the country was like, but the morasses and other obstacles
were so great that they could not, and so they were obliged to keep
along the river bank, though with much difficulty, for the creeks in
the swamps were so deep that swimming the horses through them was an
arduous task. Some Spaniards and horses were drowned. The Indian men
and women carrying loads could not cross these swamps on foot, so
they looked for some of the canoes which the natives had hidden. When
the bad places were narrow they made bridges of trees, and crossed in
that manner. In this way they advanced down the river for forty-three
marches, and there was not a day when they did not come upon one or
two of these creeks, so deep that they were put to the labour we have
described, each time. They found little food and no inhabitants, and
they began to feel the pangs of hunger, for of the herd of swine they
brought from Quito, numbering more than 5,000, all were eaten. At
this time the Chief Delicola, who was the first that came in friendly
guise, and the other prisoners, for fear the Spaniards would kill
them, declared that farther on they would find a rich and well-peopled
land. Observing one day that they were less carefully watched, they
slipped into the river with their chain, and crossed to the other
side, without the Spaniards being able to retake them. The Spaniards
thus found themselves without guides for advancing, and they consulted
as to what it would be best to do. As the Indians had said that after
fifteen marches they would come to another very broad and swift river,
down which there were large settlements and very rich Chiefs, also
such quantities of food that if there were a thousand Spaniards there
would be enough for all, Gonzalo Pizarro ordered the Captain-general
Francisco de Orellana, with seventy men, to go on and see if what
the Indians had said was true, and to return with the vessel full
of provisions, for they saw the great need there was for food. He
himself, with the rest of his force, would march down stream at
once, to reach the populous country as soon as possible. For all the
Spaniards were in want, and in truth their necessity was dire, so that
Orellana must make all speed to bring them relief. He was not to do
anything else; wherefore the vessel was entrusted to his care solely,
and to no other person. Francisco de Orellana replied that he would
use all possible diligence to carry out his orders, that he would
bring back provisions as quickly as he could, and that there need
be no doubt about that. So he took on board some arms and clothing
belonging to Gonzalo Pizarro and others who wished to send them on,
and then departed down the river, leaving Gonzalo Pizarro and the
other Spaniards longing for his quick return.

                             CHAPTER XXI

   _How Francisco de Orellana went down the river until he reached
   the Ocean Sea, and of the great sufferings of Gonzalo Pizarro
   and his followers from hunger._


Gonzalo Pizarro, having decided to send Francisco de Orellana in the
vessel down the river, ordered him to start at once, and to those who
were to travel with him he repeated the instructions he had given
to Orellana himself. They therefore proceeded down stream, taking
scarcely any provisions with them, and suffered very great hardships,
making their way for days without seeing any inhabitant. At the end
of that time they met with a few and began to talk of returning, but
this seemed an impossible task, for they had traversed more than three
hundred leagues.

Orellana, after stating some excuses, continued his way and discovered
the very wide river Marañón or "_Mar Dulce_" as some call it, with
great provinces and settlements on its banks, so large that they
affirm that in passing continuously down stream for two whole days
they did not come to the end of the populated district. They had some
fights with the Indians, and a few Spaniards were wounded. Father
Gaspar de Caravajal lost an eye. They never found gold or silver, but
some Indians they captured told them that those metals existed in
great quantities in the interior. After passing through still greater
hardships they at length arrived at the Ocean Sea, whence Orellana
went to Spain; and his Majesty granted him that province with the
title of Adelantado.[41] Publishing an account of greater things than
he ever saw, he enlisted many people. With them he entered the mouth
of the great river and died miserably, all his followers being lost as
well.

Let us return to Gonzalo Pizarro who, when he had despatched his
lieutenant-general Francisco de Orellana down the river in the vessel,
as we have related, determined to push forward from that place as
best he could. He had no provisions, nor any knowledge of whither
he might be able to go. There was not even any track to follow. The
heavens poured down water from their clouds in such quantities that
for many days, including nights, the rain never ceased. As for those
swamps we have mentioned, the farther the Spaniards went the more
of them they encountered. To enable them to proceed and bring along
the horses the strongest young men went ahead, opening a road with
axes and wood knives, never ceasing to cut through that dense wild
in such a way that all the camp could pass and journey eastward. As
they were in such an evil land and might not find any village, they
determined to wait and see what the captain Francisco de Orellana
could do for them. Meanwhile, not to die of hunger, they ate some
remaining horses, and dogs, without wasting any of the entrails, skin,
or other parts; for all was food for the Spaniards. At this time they
had come in sight of an island in the river; but facing it, on the
mainland where the Spaniards had to pass, there were great swamps and
bogs which they could not traverse. To arrive at the supposed land of
plenty which Orellana might discover down the river, they would have
to build boats and big rafts near this island, and these must be well
supplied with provisions and fit to receive the remaining horses on
board, and everything else. They could then go down the river without
danger, and in a short time enter the region where they expected to
find settlements so large and well-to-do that the mere mention of
them excites astonishment, though we know positively it is truth, and
rather under than over stated.

Gonzalo Pizarro, finding himself near this island, and not knowing
the kind of road there might be ahead, and considering the want of
provisions from which all the Spaniards were suffering, now ordered
the captain Alonso de Mercadillo to go down the river with a dozen
Spaniards, in some canoes they had, to see if there was any sign of
Francisco de Orellana, and to seek for some fruit or roots by which
the Spaniards might be sustained. Mercadillo was away for eight days,
without finding anything whatever, nor any sign of Indians. Great was
the sorrow of Gonzalo Pizarro and his followers when they heard this.
It seemed as if they were quite lost, for they had nothing to eat
but wild herbs and coarse fruits never before seen or known, and the
horses and dogs; and these on so restricted a dole that rather did it
whet their hunger than relieve their yearning for food.

As they were in such great straits that there seemed no remedy either
by advancing or by going back, Gonzalo Pizarro resolved to send canoes
with other persons, to see if any signs of natives or homesteads
could be found, where they could get food; for if they delayed much
longer they must all inevitably perish. He therefore ordered the
captain Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda to go out and make search with some
others. They embarked in the canoes and went down stream until they
came to another river larger and mightier than the one they had been
navigating, the two becoming one. Here they saw cuts made by wood
knives and swords, showing that Orellana and his companions had been
there. As they were so ravening and wishful to reach some place where
there was food, they considered, on seeing such a large river, that it
would be well to go up it and see what could be found. After having
gone up it for ten leagues, God our Lord was pleased that they should
find many very thick patches of _yuca_,[42] so large that the stems
that came from their roots looked like a small forest. This _yuca_
plantation was due to certain Indians who had previously lived for
some years in that locality. Their neighbours, in a war they waged
upon them, forced them to retire farther inland into the mountains.
Hence these _yucas_ they had planted continued to grow and remain
there as we have described, and afforded no small relief to the
exhausted Spaniards. Those who came in the canoes knew the _yucas_
quite well. So they went down on their knees and gave thanks to God
our Lord for His great mercy. Then they began to pull them up and load
the two canoes, returning with them full to where Gonzalo Pizarro was
waiting, where the Spaniards had already given up all hope of escaping
with their lives. When they saw the canoes and learnt what they
brought, they all wept for joy, saying, "Blessed be the Lord our God
who has thus remembered us," while kneeling on the ground, and turning
their eyes heavenward; thus giving Him thanks for a mercy which they
held to be a very great one.

For twenty-seven days Gonzalo Pizarro had been there with his party,
eating nothing but some horse and dog-flesh with herbs and leaves of
trees. They had also eaten the saddle and stirrup leathers, boiled
in water and afterwards toasted over the ashes. So that we have good
reason for saying that this expedition of discovery had to endure
great hardships and want. The _yucas_ brought in the canoes were
divided out, but they did not wait to wash or clean them, and began to
eat with the earth still sticking to them. And when they all learnt
that the _yuca_ plantations were near, they collected all the canoes
and fastened them securely together with strong cords to cross to the
other side of the river, which was about three cross-bow shots in
width. The surviving horses crossed easily, as the current was not
strong. Then the people, with what baggage remained to them, were
ferried over with much trouble and made their way to the place on the
other river where the _yuca_ thicket had been found. At that time the
fury of their hunger was such that a Spaniard named Villarejo began to
eat a root of a white colour and rather thick. He had scarcely tasted
it when he lost his reason and became mad. The Spaniards made a very
hurried traverse, crossing more creeks and small streams until they
arrived at the _yuca_ plantation. As all came in an exhausted state,
not having eaten anything for so many days, they did nothing but pull
up _yucas_, with the earth still sticking to the roots, and began to
eat them at once. There they formed a camp, and remained for eight
days. The Spaniards were very sick and sore, wan, and wretched, and in
such an afflicted condition that it was very sad to look upon them.

[41] Thus was the mighty river Amazon discovered by this inhuman
traitor.

                             CHAPTER XXII

   _How Gonzalo Pizarro arrived, with his followers, at a place
   where Indians had formerly settled but had been driven out in a
   war, and the Spaniards found a very great quantity of yucas, by
   means of which they were restored to health and their lives were
   saved; and of the hardships they went through._


Having arrived at the _yuca_ plantation in the way we have recounted,
and seeing that there were abundant roots to sustain them, the
Spaniards felt that our Lord had shown them the greatest mercy in the
world, and such was their joy that they shed many tears, giving Him
thanks. In the days that they were there, the native servants having
failed them, they themselves grated the _yucas_ by means of very sharp
thorns that grow on certain trees in those forests, and made bread of
the meal, finding it to be as wholesome as the white rusks of Utrera.
Assuredly Gonzalo Pizarro performed great service in this expedition.
If he had not afterwards blemished his fame with the name of traitor,
his great services should for ever be held in memory. But in this
history, being that of the beginning or childhood of the deeds done
by the Spaniards in these realms, we shall record the events as they
happened, neither failing to mention the evil deeds and atrocities,
nor omitting to relate the good works.

Returning to our narrative, the _yucas_ which the Spaniards found in
this locality, where there is nothing else in those dense and evil
forests, were an immense resource.

As the Indians had formerly lived on those flats, and their principal
sustenance is _yuca_, they had laid out great plantations of this
root, extending for more than forty leagues. But their neighbours
having fought with these natives until they were driven from thence,
all that _yuca_ harvest remained to enable the Spaniards to restore
their well-being with it. At the end of eight days Gonzalo Pizarro
ordered that all should depart and travel up stream, to see if God,
our Lord, would be pleased to guide the expedition to some good land,
or back to that from which they had come. At that plantation two
Spaniards died through eating too many _yucas_. Others swelled in such
a way that they could not walk on their feet. They were put on the
horses, in the saddles, and secured with cords so that they should not
fall off, for they had not strength to keep on horseback. Although
they complained, they were not helped, for the others said that they
were acting like rogues, and that there was nothing the matter with
them.

Spaniards went in front of the main body, opening a road through the
forest with axes and wood knives. Many had to go barefoot, for they
had no _alpargates_[43] nor anything else to put on. They believed
that Orellana and the others who went down the river were dead, either
from starvation or at the hands of the Indians. Some Spaniards always
marched in the rear guard, not allowing any to lag behind, the sick
being put on the horses, as we have already said. They marched along
the banks for forty leagues, always finding _yuca_ plantations; but
the horses were so lean and weak that they were of little use. When
they had completed those forty leagues they came to a small settlement
of natives, but they had no interpreter to ask them what they wanted
to know. When the natives saw the Spaniards with horses, they were
terrified, got into their canoes, and from thence made signs and
brought some of their food for the Spaniards. They pitched it ashore
to them in exchange for hawks' bells, combs, and other trifles which
the Spaniards always carried with them. They went on from this place
for eight days; exploring the region up stream, and always finding it
sparsely settled like the one they had left. After they had travelled
for these eight days there were no longer any Indians, nor any track
leading in any direction, because the natives from this point used the
river as their only road. By signs the natives said that there were no
roads and no provisions farther on. When the Spaniards heard this they
sought for food from the store the Indians had; as much as each one
could carry on his back and on the horses.

Gonzalo Pizarro was very sad. He knew not in what land he was,
nor what direction to take to reach Peru or any other part where
there were Christians. He took counsel with Don Antonio, Sancho de
Caravajal, Villegas, Funes, and Juan de Acosta. Their conclusion was
that Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda should be sent out in two canoes strongly
lashed together, to explore the river, with Indians to help in working
them up stream. He was to go up and try to find a well-peopled
locality, and then Gonzalo Pizarro would follow with the whole camp.
Gonzalo Díaz presently started in the canoes, taking with him a
cross-bow and an arquebus; and Gonzalo Pizarro also set out with the
rest. But he was in great anxiety, for the Spaniards were in a very
bad state. They had eaten nothing but the _yucas_, and this brought
on a flux which wore them out; besides that they all went with bare
feet and legs, for they had nothing in the way of shoes, except that
a few made a sort of sandal from the leather of the saddles. The road
was all through forest, and full of prickly trees: so that their feet
got scratched all over, and their legs were constantly pierced by the
many thorns. In this condition they went on, nearly dead with hunger,
naked and barefooted, covered with sores, opening the road with their
swords; while it rained so that on many days they never saw the sun
and could not get dry. They cursed themselves many times for having
come to suffer such hardships and privations, which they could well
have avoided, Peru being so large and populous a country, where all
may obtain relief.

Those who went in the canoe made a signal every night, to show how
they went forward, and Gonzalo Pizarro with his followers worked their
way through the forest in the laborious manner we have described. So
they went on for fifty-six leagues, Pizarro by land and Gonzalo Díaz
on the river. They met no natives, and had no food but the _yucas_
they brought with them and the insipid wild fruits they found among
those mountains. Gonzalo Díaz, who went on the river, reflecting that
they had gone fifty leagues without striking anything, was very sad.
He thought that Gonzalo Pizarro and all his men must die of hunger, as
they could find no inhabited land. One day, at the hour of compline,
they encountered a strong current which they were unable to stem, so
they jumped ashore. On a trunk of a tree, brought down by the current,
they sat pondering over their misery. They were very anxious, thinking
that it would be impossible for Gonzalo Pizarro and the others to
reach this place, owing to the density of the forest and the large
affluents that came to join the river. As they were thus thinking, Don
Pedro de Bustamente, who accompanied Gonzalo Díaz, stood up and saw
a canoe at a bend of the river near where they were, and in a little
while fourteen or fifteen more appeared, there being eight or nine
Indians in each canoe with their arms and shields. As soon as they
saw the canoes, the captain Gonzalo Díaz got fire from his flint and
steel, and with it he lighted the match of the arquebus. Bustamente
took the cross-bow, and putting a shaft into it, they held them
ready until they saw what the Indians, who came on careless of being
about to meet the Spaniards, would do. When they came within range,
Gonzalo Díaz pointed the arquebus and hit an Indian in the breast, who
presently fell into the river dead. Bustamente, with the cross-bow,
let fly a shaft and hit another in the arm, who very quickly pulled it
out and turned to hurl the missile at him who shot it off. Then with
loud yells, they hurled many darts and arrows. The two Spaniards as
quickly loaded the arquebus again and set the cross-bow. With these
they killed two more Indians, and then, laying hold of their swords
and shields, they approached the enemy in their canoe.

The Indians, astounded at seeing four of their number dead, began
a flight in their canoes down the river. The Spaniards followed,
shooting at them with the arquebus. This scared them so that they left
the canoes and jumped into the river. The Spaniards took some of the
canoes and found food in them of the kind used by the Indians, for
which they gave thanks to Our Lord, for it was many days since they
had tasted anything but roots and herbs which they found on the banks
of the river. These Indians had come from a river which is different
from this one, and two of them, with two canoes, had been fishing when
they saw the Spaniards and went to give the alarm to their village.
So the people of the village came out by a creek which falls into the
river, thinking to take or kill the Spaniards. The event turned out
as you have heard. Gonzalo Díaz and Bustamente, after they had eaten,
cut some crosses on trees near the river with their swords, so that if
Gonzalo Pizarro and his people should come that way, they would know
that they had been there and gone on. That night they resumed their
voyage up the river, and the morning dawned very clear. Casting their
eyes towards the south they saw a range of very high mountains, at
which they rejoiced greatly for they thought it must be the Cordillera
of Quito, or that which lies near the cities of Popayán and Cali. In
that case the Spaniards would not be lost, for God our Lord would
guide them to a Christian land. Presently they found some stones,
at a rapid. Never before had they seen any in the more than 300
leagues that they had traversed. Having gone so far up the river, they
determined to go back and see whether Gonzalo Pizarro and his people
were coming. Leaving some of the food and canoes, they turned back
down the river, and what had taken them eleven days to accomplish in
going up, they now covered in a day and a half.

Gonzalo Pizarro continued to advance with his people, suffering
terribly from famine, for now they had eaten all the dogs, numbering
more than nine hundred, except two: one belonging to Gonzalo Pizarro,
and the other to Don Antonio Rivera. They had also eaten most of
the horses they had brought. The Spaniards were so tired and worn
out, that they could hardly walk, while several died in the forest.
Going down the river Gonzalo Díaz heard the noise of people cutting
the trees with their swords. Very joyfully he landed at the spot the
Spaniards had reached, and they were delighted to see each other.
Gonzalo Pizarro was coming with the rear-guard, lest any of the
Spaniards should drop and be left for dead. When Gonzalo Díaz heard
this he got into the canoe again and went to meet him. We cannot
describe the joy they felt at seeing each other, for Díaz had believed
Pizarro to be already dead.[44] He and Bustamente related to Gonzalo
Pizarro how they had come back to seek for him, because in going up
the river they had encountered armed Indians, and God had delivered
them out of their hands, and given them strength to kill four of
them with the arquebus and cross-bow, making them take to flight
and abandon their canoes, in which they found some food. They also
reported having seen very high mountains and that they believed that
they would there find inhabitants, or a road which would lead to a
land of Christians. They also said they had found a great beach on
the river, covered with stones. Gonzalo Pizarro rejoiced at this news.
We will here leave off writing about him, to relate other important
things which happened within the Realm.

                            CHAPTER XXIII

   _How his Majesty appointed Belalcázar as his Governor, and how
   he entered upon the government and arrested the Adelantado
   Andagoya._


In the first book we mentioned how the captain Sebastián de
Belalcázar, being on an expedition of discovery, arrived at the
province of Bogotá, called the New Kingdom of Granada, where he found
some Spaniards of Santa Marta, who were the first discoverers of those
parts. Belalcázar, Fedreman, and the licentiate Jiménez embarked
together in one ship, each one desirous that the government of the
country should be given to himself. Although each one came to Spain
with the intention of applying for it, their hopes were disappointed,
for it was granted to Don Alonso de Lugo, Adelantado of the Canaries.
When the captain Belalcázar arrived in Spain he found that his Majesty
was absent, enjoying his immortal triumphs. It was easy for those who
came to Spain to negotiate, in those days, as the lords of the Council
favoured captains who approached them to seek posts; and Belalcázar,
after he had submitted his report, was given the government of Popayán
with the towns of Anzerma, Cartago, Cali, and Neyva, with all the
territory as far as the boundaries of San Francisco de Quito. With
these grants and favours he left Spain and came to Tierra Firme. At
the city of Panamá he embarked in a ship, with those in his company,
and landed near the harbour now called Buenaventura; whence he
continued his journey to the city of Cali, where news of his coming as
Governor had already arrived. Andagoya worked to obtain friends and
interest and resist Belalcázar's entry, and strove for the support of
the city magistrates and aldermen. Although they all raised his hopes
and made great promises, they desired first to see Belalcázar there
before their eyes, and then on his arrival to desert Andagoya and go
over to him. For novelties please the people, who are always friends
to anything new, and they like to see changes, especially among those
who govern.

Many letters, with great promises, came to Belalcázar; and Andagoya,
suspecting some persons, arrested them, and prepared to send men
into the hill country to block the arrival. After some things had
passed which I cannot now recount, and there had been emissaries
and proposals, Belalcázar arrived at the city of Cali. There, lest
he should have to decide by force who had the best title to govern,
he put his men under arms; and Andagoya did likewise with those who
supported him. They were almost coming to blows when some monks
intervened. It was then agreed that the Governor Belalcázar should
present his credentials to the municipality, and if they accepted
them he was to be acknowledged as Governor, but if not, then Andagoya
was to remain in office. By this time many who were at Cali had gone
over to Belalcázar's side. After seeing his credentials the municipal
delegates accepted him as Governor, and removed the Adelantado from
office. A few days later Andagoya was made a prisoner and taken to
the city of Popayán. Belalcázar then wrote to the captain Robledo,
and sent Pedro de Ayala to take possession of the cities of Cartago
and Anzerma, with orders that the city of Santa Ana, then called San
Juan, was to be henceforth styled the town of Anzerma. Pedro de Ayala
arrived at Cartago, where the captain Jorge de Robledo distributed
what caciques were there, among the conquerors, and for those other
Spaniards who received no _repartimiento_ he determined to go and
find Indians. So he proceeded from Cartago to the town of Anzerma,
whence he wrote letters to Belalcázar, for he knew that certain
persons, actuated by envy and malice, were speaking evil of him before
Belalcázar and that Belalcázar approved--for he was a man of little
knowledge and poor understanding, unable to take the measure of those
who came with false or unjust statements. The captain Jorge Robledo,
desiring to do what we have said, set out from Anzerma, taking as
his ensign the captain Álvaro de Mendoza, a principal knight among
those engaged in that campaign, who had served his Majesty for many
years. With a hundred Spaniards, horse and foot, they left Anzerma,
crossed the great river, and came to the village of _Irra_. Leaving
the affairs of that government at this point, we will return to our
principal subject, and relate how the licentiate Cristóbal Vaca de
Castro was appointed in Spain to be Governor of Peru.




                             CHAPTER XXIV

   _How the alcalde Diego Núñez de Mercado arrived in Spain with
   news of the death of Almagro; how his Majesty deemed that event
   to be an ill service, and how he appointed the licentiate
   Cristóbal Vaca de Castro as Judge._


The _alcalde_ Diego Núñez de Mercado, ever the faithful adherent
of the Adelantado Don Diego de Almagro, left Peru as quickly as
possible after his friend was beheaded, and embarked in a ship for
Tierra Firme. Thence he travelled and sailed until he reached the
Court of his Majesty with the news of the battle of Las Salinas and
the death of Almagro, and all the other events that had happened in
Peru. His knowledge was complete, for he was a third party in all
the negotiations and agreements between the two Governors. When the
Emperor heard of the death of Almagro he was much grieved, and held
that what had taken place in Peru was detrimental to his service. His
Majesty was angry that such a loyal servant and vassal should have
been put to death with such cruelty, and ordered the members of his
Council to see justice done in the case. Soon afterwards Diego de
Alvarado, and also Diego Gutiérrez de los Rios, arrived in Spain. They
too related the execution of Almagro, and prayed for justice.

Then Don Alonso Enríquez arrived in Spain with others, who told the
story differently; so that the Council of the Indies, in order to get
at the truth, nominated the licentiate Cristóbal Vaca de Castro as
Judge of Commission, to go out and collect evidence. Some say that
Hernando Pizarro obtained this appointment, through the Cardinal
Loaysa, that he might have charge of the affairs of the Marquis
Pizarro, because he would show himself favourable in that interest.
However that may have been, this licentiate was ordered to proceed to
Peru to investigate what we have said, and if perchance the Marquis
Don Francisco Pizarro should die before the Judge's arrival or while
he was there, he was to assume the government in the place of the
said Marquis. And as some complaints against Dr. Robles, a judge of
the Panamá Audience, had reached Spain, it was ordered that the Judge
Vaca de Castro should be President of the Panamá Audience so long as
he was there, and take steps to call Judge Robles and Dr. Villalobos
to account. On leaving that Audience in good order, he was to set out
for Peru. Having arrived there, he was to take evidence and make a
thorough inquiry into the course of recent events there, and send home
a report.

Vaca de Castro accepted the appointment, and had great hopes that,
with diligence, he would be able to perform the duties and do good
service to his Majesty. As soon as the appointment of Vaca de Castro
was announced in Spain, Diego de Alvarado and others wrote to Diego
de Almagro and Juan de Herrada, saying that Dr. Beltrán and other
members of the Council had received large presents from the Marquis,
whence it must be inferred that Vaca de Castro would not do strict
justice there. These letters caused some perturbation in the minds
of the men of Chile. Vaca de Castro, as soon as he had received his
sailing orders, took leave of the Court and proceeded to San Lucar,
where he embarked, with the title of President of the Audience of
Panamá. Correspondents were not wanting who informed the Marquis of
the appointment of Vaca de Castro, and of the very limited powers he
brought with him, telling Pizarro that he need have no mistrust, as
the Judge was going out rather to show him a favour, and that he would
suffer no dishonour in consequence.

Vaca de Castro sailed across the ocean until he came to Nombre de
Dios, whence he proceeded to Panamá, arriving in the middle of
January, 1542. It was given out that he came with wide powers and
commissions. Arrived at Panamá, he was received as President in the
Audience and Royal Chancellery. In the Audience Dr. Robles and Dr.
Villalobos were judges. As soon as Vaca de Castro had been received by
them as President, he produced a royal commission by which his Majesty
ordered him to investigate the judges' proceedings, especially those
of Dr. Francisco Robles, who had held office for a long time, and
respecting whose acts several complaints had reached Spain. Presently
this officer was suspended from duty, and his case was investigated.
As Vaca de Castro was anxious to get on to Peru, he handed over
the completion of the case to Dr. Villalobos, against whom there
was nothing, and to the licentiate Páez de Laserna, who had lately
arrived from Spain as a judge. He then arranged for his own departure,
and quitted the harbour of Panamá in a galleon belonging to Dr.
Sepúlveda. There went with him Don Pedro Luis Cabrera, and Hernán
Mejía, an alderman of the city of Seville. There were also with him
Juan de Cáceres, Accountant of Peru, and Sebastián de Merlo, who had
been the secretary of that Audience. He sailed for Peru, accompanied
by several other ships, on the 18th of March in the year 1542.




                             CHAPTER XXV

   _Of what happened in the city of Lima, and how Pedro Alvarez
   Holguin left the city of Cuzco on an expedition of discovery._


The coming of Vaca de Castro as Judge was publicly known in Lima
through letters that had arrived from Spain; and the men of Chile
anxiously awaited the hour of his arrival, when they would seek for
justice respecting the putting to death of Don Diego de Almagro. They
were in very great need, and the Marquis did nothing to alleviate
their condition. There was an estate with some Indians which, it was
said, Domingo de la Presa had given or sold to Don Diego.[45] It
happened that Domingo de la Presa died at this time, and Francisco
Martín de Alcántara, brother of the Marquis, asked for the estate.
There were even some words about it, for the Bishop, as was said, also
had pretensions. Finally the Marquis took it away from Don Diego and
gave it to Francisco Martín. This was assuredly a great injustice,
and not in conformity with the position and claims of Don Diego,
having regard to his father's services to the King. As maize and other
supplies for Don Diego's house, where all the men of Chile boarded,
were obtained from this estate, they felt the want so much that it was
pitiful to hear what the lad Don Diego said, and how he complained of
the harshness with which the Marquis treated him. Juan de Herrada, who
had formerly been his father's servant, sought by every means for food
to sustain Don Diego and his followers, who had become very poor. It
is true that the Marquis, in order to make friends with some of them,
sent word to the captains Juan de Sayavedra, Cristóbal de Sotelo, and
Francisco de Chaves that he would give them Indian bondsmen whereby
they might live in comfort: but they scoffed at a promise of that
sort, saying that they would rather die of hunger than receive food at
the hands of the Marquis.

In view of the current news of the coming of Vaca de Castro, the men
of Chile determined to send Alonso de Montemayor and Juan de Baeza,
dressed in mourning, to welcome the Judge at Piura, or wherever they
could overtake him, and when they reached him they were to petition
for restitution of what they had lost, and punishment of their enemies
for the treason of having killed the Adelantado. Some there were who
said that Juan de Herrada and young Almagro conspired together to
find out the intentions of Vaca de Castro, and, if these were not
in agreement with what they expected and believed, to kill him and
seize all the arms he might have with him. This is the story told
by the Pachacama party, but at that time no such plot to murder
Vaca de Castro was in being or even discussed among them, nor did
they send the deputies for any other purpose than to acquaint him
with the course of events, and also to learn, perchance, whether he
came with intent to favour the Marquis and not to do full justice
to them. If so, they would prepare to arm and, with some friends,
they would defend themselves against any one who should wish to
annoy them. Presently those two set out to do what we have stated.
When the Marquis heard of the approach of Vaca de Castro, he sent a
chamberlain named Alonso de Cabrera to receive him, and to see the
lodgings prepared for him, where he was to rest on the road. Although
the Marquis felt sore at the coming of Vaca de Castro, he prudently
dissembled, and gave out that he was pleased at his arrival. At this
time Pedro Alvarez Holguin had gone on an expedition of discovery
with a small force, in the direction of the Chunchos. Don Pedro de
Puertocarrero was then lieutenant for the Governor at Cuzco. Captain
Pedro Anzures was in the town of Plata, where many gentlemen of rank
had settled; and had instituted good order among the Indians in those
provinces. Those who would not acknowledge their subjection, nor
render obedience to his Majesty, were punished and forced to submit.
In the other towns and new settlements the same care was observed.
In Lima, as well as in all the other cities of the Realm, a great
quantity of wheat and barley was raised.

Now the Marquis was guided by the counsels of his secretary Antonio
Picado, who was not a man of constancy or prudence. It would have been
well to lead the Marquis towards a policy of conciliation, which would
have attracted friends; but Picado did just the reverse. He said many
ugly things of the men of Chile, and it was through his scheming that
the farm was taken from the lad Don Diego and given over to Francisco
Martín. To insult the men of Chile, Picado one day put on embroidered
clothes enriched with many gold figs,[46] and went in that garb to
the quarters of young Diego. There he made his horse plunge and caper
about to the bodily danger of those present, as if with intent to
knock them over. Those of Chile felt hurt and insulted when they saw
this, deploring that their misfortunes and ill-luck were such that
Picado could come thus and triumph over them. From that time their
suspicions grew, and they were in dread lest the Marquis should kill
or banish them, so they sought for arms to defend themselves. The
Marquis was informed of this, and he was counselled by his friends
to keep people about him to guard his person, that he might not be
murdered on a sudden. But he would not take their advice; on the
contrary, he went out of his house every day alone. He went to a place
where a mill was being built, where the men of Chile might have killed
him many times, if they had cared to station themselves there.

                             CHAPTER XXVI

   _Of what happened to the President Vaca de Castro, after he left
   the city of Panamá to go to Peru._


After leaving Panamá all went well in the vessel on board of which
Vaca de Castro and his friends had embarked, and the vessels
accompanying her, until they came to a rocky islet called by the
sailors "_Mal Pelo_." Thence they sailed along the coast until they
sighted the Island of _La Gorgona_, which is near the river of San
Juan. After that the winds were contrary, and the rains frequent. Then
the sea became tempestuous, bearing on its waves the vessels that
had come from Panamá. After some days they sighted the Island of _El
Gallo_, whither the pilot and captain ordered the sailors to steer,
as they wished to renew their supply of water. Pedro Luis Cabrera,
Hernán Mejía and some others landed. While they were on shore, the
hawser which secured the vessel carried away, and those who had gone
on shore were only got on board again with great difficulty. At length
they were able to continue the voyage, and arrived at the _Ancón de
Sardinas_. On the night of their arrival there arose a furious gale,
insomuch that they thought they were lost. All the vessels put to
sea, but when daylight came the galleon was alone, no other vessel
being in sight. When the pilot saw this he wanted to return to Ancón
de Sardinas, but was unable to, as the vessel had drifted too far to
leeward. Night coming on, and being near the land, the pilot anchored
the vessel with good cables so as to ride through the night without
drifting, with the contrary wind, from the place into which they had
come. But after a short time a sailor cried out that they were driving
on shore. They slipped the anchor and stood out to sea under the
foresail, so, in spite of the efforts of the pilot, they were unable
to hold their own. They ran for the island of El Gallo, where they
found a ship at anchor. They believed she was one of those which had
started with them; but it was not so, she had come from Nicaragua.

Vaca de Castro ordered Merlo to go to that vessel in the boat, and
to require those in command on board to come and appear before him.
There came one named Pedro Orejón, who was married to a daughter of
the Governor Rodrigo de Contreras, and another named Juan de Quiñones,
a settler in the city of León. As soon as they learnt that Vaca de
Castro was on board the galleon they came to pay their respects. He
asked them to keep him company, as he had lost touch with the vessels
which left Panamá with him. They answered that they would do so. So
they got up their anchors and left that place, to sail on along the
coast. But although they used all their skill to gain southing they
could not do so, by reason of the adverse weather which would in no
wise allow them to proceed. When Vaca de Castro saw how difficult
it was to make way against the contrary winds, and reflected how
desirable it was to reach his destination speedily, to prevent trouble
between the respective parties of Chile and of Pachacama, he consulted
with those on board. They agreed that, as the contrary winds were so
persistent, and there was a deficiency of cables and gear, it would be
better to make for the port of Buenaventura, whence they could march
to the city of Cali, where they would find all the outfit necessary
for a journey to Peru. Vaca de Castro and those on board both the
vessels having come to this decision they steered for the Isle of
Palms. No one on board either ship knew the port of Buenaventura,
it being situated between rivers, with very dense forests on either
side; so that to make no mistake it is necessary to know it well.
I myself, having once gone to Panamá to negotiate certain business
with the Royal Chancellery, returned to the province by way of this
port. Though I had a pilot with me, named Martín Hernández, who had
been there twice before, we missed our mark and thought we had lost
ourselves, because one has to enter by two or three branches of the
rivers to get into the one by which vessels are brought up to the
port by the tide. We were eleven days in those rivers seeking for the
port and never able to find it; nor should we have got there at all,
if it had not been for a skipper who was coming out in a small vessel
on a fishing cruise. He piloted us into the branch of the river which
leads to Buenaventura. I mention this because Vaca de Castro had much
trouble in finding the port, as there is much risk in trying to enter,
for those who have never seen it before.

Having arrived at the Isle of Palms they were very puzzled over the
means to be adopted for finding the port. They found an inscription
cut in large letters on a rock in the island, to the following effect:
_Whoever comes in search of the port of Buenaventura should sail for
six leagues to the west, and on the beach at which he will arrive he
will see a large cross, and on digging at the foot of it will find a
calabash containing a letter which tells where the port is_. They were
all much pleased at finding this writing, and Vaca de Castro ordered
a sailor who understood navigation to go in the boat and seek for the
letter at the cross, for then they could not possibly go wrong. He
ordered Merlo to go with him in the boat. They started, and presently
arrived where the letters on the rock directed. They found the cross
cut down by the coast Indians, but, after a diligent search, could not
find the letter. As the cross had been cut down, they decided to go
towards a bay or roadstead that the coast forms. They wandered about
for eight days without being able to find anything, nor any sign of a
port. After those eight days the boat returned to the galleon, where
the crew had suffered much from hunger, and must have succumbed if it
had not been for the Nicaraguan ship which supplied them out of the
stores she had brought.




                            CHAPTER XXVII

   _How the President Vaca de Castro was in great need and danger
   from being unable to find the port of Buenaventura; and how, at
   the end of some days during which they were seeking the port,
   they sighted a ship in which there came Don Juan de Andagoya,
   who told them where the port was._


Great was the disappointment of those on board the ships when the
boat's crew who had gone in search of the cross and the letter
supposed to be deposited there reported their non-success. Vaca de
Castro was very worried and depressed. He ordered another pilot to
take the boat and some sailors, and see whether peradventure they
could find the port, for the want of provisions was now such that with
even but a little more delay, the danger would become very serious. So
the pilot and boat's crew started a second time to seek for the port,
with a limit of eight days within which to go and return. Although
they went along coastwise, and entered several rivers that came down
from the mountains into the sea, they could find no sign nor trace
of a port, nor anything that might guide them. Being on the point of
returning to the Isle of Palms, that Vaca de Castro might go back
to Panamá by reason of the failure of provisions, they sighted two
sails coming along the coast, steering towards where the boat then
was. They saw them anchor, and stow their sails, and the strangers
then made towards them in their boats, for they were in the same
predicament as themselves, as they had come from Nicaragua, and their
pilots, having never been at Buenaventura, did not know the way to the
port. They thought that those in the boat they had sighted would be
able to guide them in the right direction. When the two parties heard
from each other what they were after, they were greatly depressed.
They agreed to make for that bay again, with all three boats, and see
if they could find the port from thence. That night a great tempest
arose, and they thought they must perish.

Meanwhile Vaca de Castro and the crews of the ships suffered much
from want of food; when the boats were about to return, there came in
sight a ship which had just left the port of Buenaventura. On board
of her was Don Juan de Andagoya, son of the Adelantado Don Pascual de
Andagoya. He was in search of the captain Cristóbal de Peñas,[47] and
was coming to seek an order from the Royal Audience of Panamá to the
Adelantado Sebastián de Belalcázar to allow his father, who was held
a prisoner, to depart freely whither he chose. When Don Juan came out
of the mouth of the river and saw the other vessels, he got into the
ship's boat and went to see who they were and what they wanted. There
was a heavy sea, Don Juan lost the rudder, and if they had not come to
his help he would have perished. When they heard from Don Juan that
the port of Buenaventura was near, they were delighted, and hastened
to carry the good news to where the President was. They told Don Juan
there was no need for him to go to Panamá, for that Vaca de Castro,
who was hard by, was himself President of the Audience of Panamá, and
could liberate Don Juan's father and compensate him for the injury
done him. When Don Juan heard this he rejoiced, believing that since
Vaca de Castro came with such very full and ample powers from his
Majesty, as was stated, they would be most useful in the cause of
the Adelantado his father, and in freeing him from the clutches of
Belalcázar. So telling the boat's crews they must go up the river down
which he had come, and that they would then quickly arrive at the port
they sought, Don Juan, with his vessel, went on to the Isle of Palms,
where he found the President. Vaca de Castro gave Don Juan a warrant,
under his signature, by which Belalcázar was to release Andagoya from
the prison in which he was confined. Vaca de Castro duly arrived at
the port of Buenaventura,[48] whence he sent his secretary Merlo to
notify to Belalcázar the order for the release of Andagoya, and to let
him know that Vaca de Castro was coming to the kingdom of Peru by his
Majesty's command. Here we will leave him and relate what happened at
the city of the Kings.

FOOTNOTE:

[47] This should be Alonso de Peña, brother-in-law of Pascual de
Andagoya. When Andagoya left Panamá to take possession of his
government, he sent Peña to Santo Domingo, to collect more troops,
horses, and stores. See my translation of Andagoya's narrative,
Introduction, p. xxvi (_Hakluyt Society's vol. 34, for 1865_).

[48] Buenaventura, the port of Cali, was founded by Juan Ladrillo,
under orders from the Adelantado Pascual de Andagoya, who had received
the government of the coast thence to Panamá. The municipality of Cali
ordered that six or seven settlers should reside there to arrange for
the landing of merchandize and its transmission across the mountains
to Cali. The pilots with Vaca de Castro certainly showed great want
of intelligence in not being able to find it (see _Cieza de León_, p.
105, _Hakluyt Society's vol. 33_, _for 1864_)
